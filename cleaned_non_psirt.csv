Our defect is that an ESA, working according to how the AMP integration is designed, can hit situations where the ESA is flagging files as not AMP viral, up to 24 hours after the Amp cloud knows a file is viral.  The situation where we run into trouble, is when the initial Amp upload scan, does not find a virus, and this upload file is later reclassified as a virus.The ESA caches AMP evaluations indefinately.  And the ESA requires a retrospective answer from the cloud, to reclassify a file that was initially evaluated as non viral, as being viral.  The problem is that the retrospective data that the ESA needs, is created by batch jobs that introduce significant lags that can be over 24 hours.Lets say we have a file ;newvirus.exe;1) If the Amp upload scan does not have a virus, its cached as non viral.2) newvirus.exe, is later reclassified in the cloud as being a virus.3) The next time our ESA sees file, newvirus.exe, its handled as non viral, if we have not received back the retrospective update from the cloud.Lets say event 1 above was 25 hours ago,  and newvirus.exe gets flagged as viral now.  This data to update this viral verdict, requires a batch job to run in the cloud that only runs once every 24 hours.  Which means the ESA is going to take up to day to get this update.  This is the more unusual lag,  when a SHA hasn't been seen by an ESA for more than 1 day.  For the more common case, where an ESA has seen the virus in the past day, the batch job is run every hour, and the ESA polls for it every 15 minutes.  So the normal time where we see an ESA out of sync on viral verdicts is  1 hour + 15 mins + server propagation and job execution, which is not unusual to take around 2 hours in some cases."," PSIRT-owner: psirt@cisco.com           This issue has been evaluated and driven to closure by PSIRT.

Conditions: Default configuration.  Workaround: The CRIME vulnerability can only be exploited if both the server and web browser both support TLS compression.  Almost all modern web browsers disable compression for TLS connections.  To avoid any potential exposure to this vulnerability, please ensure that your browser does not support TLS compression.    All versions of Internet Explorer, and the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox do not support TLS compression and are therefore not vulnerable to the CRIME exploit.  Further Problem Description: The CRIME vulnerability can be exploited via TLS or SPDY compression.  We do not support the SPDY protocol currently, so only TLS compression is potentially vulnerable.

CSC.netbu,pix-asa,inspect-esmtp,customer-use,3,0,0,CSCur68226,ASA SMTP inspection should not disable TLS by default," Symptom: The Cisco ASA Software when configured with ESMTP inspection may strip the STARTTLS flags which results in STARTTLS not being negotiated. This bug is open to make the stripping of the flag optional.  Conditions: None  Workaround: If SMTP sessions need to use the STARTTLS extension to provide privacy through TLS encryption, TLS must be allowed in the ESMTP inspection policy map. The behavior described in the Interaction Between ASA ESMTP Inspection and STARTTLS section can be avoided by using the allow-tls option that is supported in Cisco ASA Software Releases 8.0.3 and later as shown here:      policy-map type inspect esmtp esmtp_map           parameters             allow-tls action log  Further Problem Description: Additional information can be found at: http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/asa_esmtp_starttls.html  PSIRT Evaluation: The Cisco PSIRT has evaluated this issue and does not meet the criteria for PSIRT ownership or involvement.

Additional information on Cisco's security vulnerability policy can be found at the following URL:  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_policy.html  ","Current behavior for SMTP inspection on ASA is to disable TLS, by masking/blocking the STARTTLS command by default. Default should be changed so STARTTLS is allowed by default, and needs from additional customer configuration to be disabled.Important note (added by jbash 2014-11-12): The fix proposed above would not meet CSDL requirements. Stripping STARTTLS, under any circumstances, is forbidden by the SEC-CRE-NOBACK requirement in the PSB, because it meets the PSB's definition of a  back door. This would be true even if it were disabled by default. Any other way of subverting encryption, other than using CA certificates installed on both ends of the application-layer connection to conduct a ;negotiated; MITM, would also be considered a back door. If the ASA really can't tolerate opportunistic SMTP encryption, its best course of action may be to drop connections upon seeing STARTTLS commands.

The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of path and file names of a DLL file before it is loaded. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious DLL file and installing it in a specific system directory. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands on the underlying Microsoft Windows host with privileges equivalent to the SYSTEM account. The attacker would need valid user credentials to exploit this vulnerability.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Additional information on Cisco's security vulnerability policy can be found at the following URL: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_policy.html  ","The Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client in Version 4.4.00243 is susceptible to a DLL Preloadingattack. While analyzing the changed behavior, it was discovered that the program, called as anargument when calling vpndownloader.exe is copied to a random (created) directory within theC:\Windows\TEMP directory before execution. This directory inherits the permission of the parentTEMP directory. This prevents the successful execution of the first PoC script. However, the issue ofunauthenticated RPC calls still exist. It is possible to circumvent the mitigation by monitoring thecreation of directories within the TEMP directory, and automatically copy a malicious DLL in a newlycreated directory to perform a DLL Preloading attack with the same PoC script used in the initialadvisory.

This may enable a ;clickjacking; attack, in which the attacker's page overlays the target application's interface with a different interface provided by the attacker. By inducing victim users to perform actions such as mouse clicks and keystrokes, the attacker can cause them to unwittingly carry out actions within the application that is being targeted. This technique allows the attacker to circumvent defenses against cross-site request forgery, and may result in unauthorized actions.Note that this issue is being reported because the application's response does not set a suitable X-Frame-Options header in order to prevent framing attacks. Some applications attempt to prevent these attacks from within the HTML page itself, using ;framebusting; code. However, this type of defense is normally ineffective and can usually be circumvented by a skilled attacker.Issue remediationYou should review the application functions that are accessible from within the response, and determine whether they can be used by application users to perform any sensitive actions within the application. If so, then a framing attack targeting this response may result in unauthorized actions.To effectively prevent framing attacks, the application should return a response header with the name X-Frame-Options and the value DENY to prevent framing altogether, or the value SAMEORIGIN to allow framing only by pages on the same origin as the response itself.

CSC.datacenter,n9k-standalone-sw,mfdm,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCum58876,RPF change is not updated correct or mfdm/ipfib crash if oifl > 40 svis," Symptom: The QA-tested scalability limit for multicast on the Nexus 9500 is 40 outgoing interfaces (OIFs) per multicast route (i.e. per (*,G) or (S,G) entry). When this is exceeded, unexpected behavior has been observed, such as:  - RPF update failure - if the RPF path for a multicast source moves from a L3 interface to a VLAN interface (SVI), this is not correctly updated in the FIB and in hardware programming. As a result, streams from this source are punted to the supervisor due to RPF failure.  - The &apos;mfdm&apos; service may crash on the supervisor, causing a HAP reset of one or both supervisors.  - The &apos;ipfib&apos; service may crash on any or all line cards and/or fabric modules, causing a HAP reset of the affected module(s).  - MTS exhaustion may be observed.  Conditions: The noted issues are known to occur when the OIF list (OIFL) exceeds 40 entries for one or more multicast routes.  The device is not guaranteed to experience these crashes or programming failures once in this state. However, once in this state, multicast churn (any actions that would require reprogramming of multiple OIF lists in hardware) can cause the aforementioned issues to appear.  Workaround: Limit the size of the OIFL for any given multicast route to 40 entries or fewer.  Further Problem Description: This issue is caused by the current N9K multicast software architecture. Large OIF lists exceed the capacity of the messages used to communicate between MFDM on the supervisor and IPFIB on the line cards, and this causes corruption which directly leads to the programming failures and crashes.  There is a two-part plan to address this:  - In the next major release (Bronte) a preventative fix will be implemented to prevent crashes and warn a user if a given OIFL exceeds 40 entries.  - In the following major release (Camden) there will be significant code re-design to increase the verified OIFL scalability numbers above 40 OIFs per group.  ","Problem: This is to track an issue where rpf change from l3 interafce to svi interface of a s,g route is not updated to fib and hardware. This is issue more happening on ECMP setup. Due to this, traffic is dropped and sent to sup for s,g rpf failure. Some times we also see ipfib mfdm crashes if we go beyond 40 svi as in oif list.Setup:====recv------EOR1====EOr2---srcHere EOR2 is a rp and 8 way ecmp between eor1 and eor2.Steps:1) Send 200 joins from 200 svi on eor12) Send source traffic from src3) observe that some of the flows are not going thru and not leanrt due to s,g, rpf failure and h/w is not updated. This is to track following things,1) RPF change is not updated to fib/hw  after RPF change of s,g2) mfdm/ipfib crash if we go beyond 40 SVI in the oif list.3) MTS buffer not enough issue if oif list beyond 50 oifstech supports and logs are attached.Also seeing mfdm crash if we go OIF/SVI more than 40 .Thanks a lotRegards..Lenin"," PSIRT-owner: psirt@cisco.com           This issue has been evaluated and driven to closure by PSIRT.

The vulnerability is due to a lack of input and validation checking mechanisms when reverting back to certain system wide authentication deployments. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to log in without being prompted to enter a valid username or password on an affected device.   Conditions: Device running an affected version of software.  Workaround: None.  Further Problem Description:  PSIRT Evaluation: The Cisco PSIRT has assigned this bug the following CVSS version 3 score. The Base CVSS score as of the time of evaluation is 4: https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:X/RL:X/RC:X  CVE ID  has been assigned to document this issue.

CSC.sys,c7200,snmp,customer-use,1,0,0,CSCdp11863,ILMI community string valid but hidden," Cisco IOS software releases based on versions 11.x and 12.0 contain    a defect that allows a limited number of SNMP objects to be viewed    and modified without authorization using a undocumented ILMI    community string. Some of the modifiable objects are confined to the    MIB-II system group, such as  ;sysContact ;,  ;sysLocation ;, and     ;sysName ;, that do not affect the device&apos;s normal operation but that    may cause confusion if modified unexpectedly. The remaining objects    are contained in the LAN-EMULATION-CLIENT and PNNI MIBs, and    modification of those objects may affect ATM configuration. An    affected device might be vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack if    it is not protected against unauthorized use of the ILMI community    string.        The vulnerability is only present in certain combinations of IOS    releases on Cisco routers and switches. ILMI is a necessary    component for ATM, and the vulnerability is present in every IOS    release that contains the supporting software for ATM and ILMI    without regard to the actual presence of an ATM interface or the    physical ability of the device to support an ATM connection.        To remove this vulnerability, Cisco is offering free software    upgrades for all affected platforms. The defect is documented in    DDTS record CSCdp11863.        In lieu of a software upgrade, a workaround can be applied to    certain IOS releases by disabling the ILMI community or  ;*ilmi ; view    and applying an access list to prevent unauthorized access to SNMP.    Any affected system, regardless of software release, may be    protected by filtering SNMP traffic at a network perimeter or on    individual devices.

CSC.sys,all,tcp,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCed38527,TCP checks should verify syn sequence number,"  A vulnerability in the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) specification (RFC793) has been discovered by an external researcher. The successful exploitation enables an adversary to reset any established TCP connection in a much shorter time than was previously discussed publicly. Depending on the application, the connection may get automatically re-established. In other cases, a user will have to repeat the action (for example, open a new Telnet or SSH session). Depending upon the attacked protocol, a successful attack may have additional consequences beyond terminated connection which must be considered. This attack vector is only applicable to the sessions which are terminating on a device (such as a router, switch, or computer) and not to the sessions that are only passing through the device (for example, transit traffic that is being routed by a router). In addition, this attack vector does not directly compromise data integrity or confidentiality.  All Cisco products which contain TCP stack are susceptible to this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20040420-tcp-ios.shtml  and it describes this vulnerability as it applies to Cisco products that run Cisco IOS software.  A companion advisory that describes this vulnerability for products that do not run Cisco IOS software is available at http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20040420-tcp-nonios.shtml   ","An outside researcher has determined that given the following information, is should be possible to reset an existing TCP connection. The first 4 are simple to determine or guess, and due to rules around TCP windowing the fifth, sequence number, should be much simpler than initially thought.      *) source IP address (easy to find with traceroute)      *) destination IP address (easy to find with traceroute)      *) source port (semi-obfuscated)      *) destination port (well known in most cases)      *) sequence number      Source and destination IP addresses should not be a problem. Source     and destination ports are a bit of the issue. One side is certainly     listening to some fixed port (173, 23, 25, whatever) and the other     is listening to some high port. Sequence number must be guessed but     only to fall within a TCP window. ACK sequence number is ignored     It has been determined that SYN packets sent within a valid window      can also kill a valid connection, as the check for the SYN-ACK      appears to be ignored."," This is a serious issue, which may be made public shortly.

CSC.sys,all,tcp,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCsv04836,Connections getting stuck at FINWAIT1 state," Multiple Cisco products are affected by denial of service (DoS) vulnerabilities that manipulate the state of Transmission Control  Protocol (TCP) connections. By manipulating the state of a TCP connection, an attacker could force the TCP connection to remain  in a long-lived state, possibly indefinitely. If enough TCP connections are forced into a long-lived or indefinite state, resources on a  system under attack may be consumed, preventing new TCP connections from being accepted. In some cases, a system reboot  may be necessary to recover normal system operation. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be able to complete a  TCP three-way handshake with a vulnerable system.  In addition to these vulnerabilities, Cisco Nexus 5000 devices contain a TCP DoS vulnerability that may result in a system crash.  This additional vulnerability was found as a result of testing the TCP state manipulation vulnerabilities.  Cisco has released free software updates for download from the Cisco website that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds  that mitigate these vulnerabilities are available.  This advisory is posted at http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20090908-tcp24.shtml.","Background information: Several TCP state table manipulation issues reported to Cisco by Robert Lee and Jack Louis of Outpost24.When running a specific tool provided by Outpost24 connections in Cisco IOS devices may get stuck in FINWAIT1 indefinitely.

It was assumed that DNS stops responding because a lot of memory was consumed by the DNS process. But this was expected in case a lot of DNS queries gets received.

Conditions: Doing test with http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris  Workaround: No. Developer need try to fix this in further release  Further Problem Description:","Release: CWMS 1.1 MR3What customer concern is : The system was found to accept weak SSL ciphers. This may allow an attacker to capture encrypted traffic and brute-force the weak encryption key.Additional Detail: The remote host supports the use of SSL ciphers that offer weak encryption. The use of RC4 in one or more cipher suites. The RC4 cipher is flawed in its generation of a pseudo-random stream of bytes so that a wide variety of small biases are introduced into the stream, decreasing its randomness. If plaintext is repeatedly encrypted (e.g. HTTP cookies), and an attacker is able to obtain many (i.e. tens of millions) ciphertexts, the attacker may be able to derive the plaintext.Input from Fonix Li:I think it is still an issue. FIPS 140-2 is a high end cryptographic standard. If it is enabled we are strong at cryptography for sure.But even if it is not enabled, we should still stick to known good cipher suites (some may be FIPS compliant and some may be not).I am not sure if Orion supports customer admin directly editing the cipher suite list ? if it is then customer can simply remove RC4 or any other cipher suites they do not like from the supported cipher suites list.If Orion does not support such customer configuration, then we may have a patch to remove the known insecure cipher suites (such as RC4).Please  go to attached mail to see the details, this bug is check item3"," PSIRT-owner: psirt@cisco.com           This issue has been evaluated and driven to closure by PSIRT.

CSC.sys,all,esg-dp-infra,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCvg89036,uCode crash observed when processing return packet in SIP ALG," $$IGNORE-PSIRT  Symptom: A CPP microcode crash may be observed during normal operation. This will result in a router reboot or a dataplane switchover, depending on whether the router in question is equipped with dataplane redundancy.  Conditions: NAT must be enabled and SIP traffic must be processed with SIP ALG. A specific scenario where this was observed was while processing a 200 OK response to a SIP REGISTER, though it is believed there are additional conditions necessary to see the problem.  Workaround: Crash can be prevented if SIP traffic is blocked across the router.  Crash can also be prevented by disabling SIP ALG with the following commands: - no ip nat service sip udp port 5060 - no ip nat service sip tcp port 5060  Disabling SIP ALG may have some impact to transit SIP traffic, if modification of SIP message parameters by NAT is needed for proper functionality.  If the above items are not feasible in the environment, no other workarounds are known at this time.

Additional information on Cisco's security vulnerability policy can be found at the following URL:  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_policy.html  ","The default configuration of the WSA has the RADIUS Change of Authorization service running and listening on all interfaces, including external interfaces. This increases the WSA's attack surface and is a violation of PSB requirements.RADIUS Change of Authorization (CoA) is an extension to the RADIUS authentication protocol that allows modification of existing sessions. If changes are made to authorization policy, the RADIUS server can pushnotifications to the WSA to reauthenticate users and apply the new policy.When the WSA starts up, it begins listening for RADIUS CoA packets on UDP port 3799 on all interfaces. This occurs whether or not RADIUS authentication has been configured. An attacker on the outside could use the open port listening on external interfaces to brute force the RADIUS secret, modify user sessions, or exploit vulnerabilities to gain a foothold in the network. The code for the RADIUS CoA server can be found in /prod/main/third_party/pyrad/pyrad/corocoaserver.py. This code path is reached from /coeus-8.5/uds/uds/main.py, with the RADIUS CoA server getting started on line 188. The IP address to listen on is never established, so the code uses a socket.bind() function call with a port and no IP address. This corresponds to INADDR_ANY, which, when listening, is interpreted as all interfaces.The RADIUS CoA listener is a violation of the PSB requirement SEC-OFF-PROC,which requires that nonessential TCP/IP services and open ports be disabled by default. The RADIUS CoA server should only be started when RADIUS authentication is configured. Additionally, the listener should only be enabled on the interface used to communicate with the RADIUS server."," PSIRT-owner: psirt@cisco.com           This issue has been evaluated by PSIRT and does not meet the criteria for PSIRT ownership or involvement.

The root issue appears to be that when getnameinfo() is unsuccessful (which occurs infrequently, and for as yet unknown reasons), namelookupd then tries to use the nslookup utility instead. However, it does not properly strip off the newline when saving the nslookup result, so extra newlines are then written out to namelookup_serial.txt. When reading this file back in, namelookupd does not handle these extraneous newlines, so its processing gets out of sync, sometimes resulting in out-of-bounds memory references.This becomes a persistent problem because there is no mechanism that automatically deletes the malformed serialized data, so namelookupd just crashes over and over again.Here is an example of a malformed entry:62111811393625730-1896360foo.bar.corp.[spurious newline here] 172.16.202.102(Note that the trailing dot in ;foo.bar.corp.; indicates that the entry came via the nslookup route.

When the leap second update occurs:  symptom 1: There is a small chance that the DCM chassis / MFP can lock up and reboot when the leap second is applied.  symptom 2: The ATSC STT table will be off by 1 extra second compared to before the leap second event  symptom 3: An ad insert scheduled during the timeframe of the transition can abort  Conditions: The leap second update will be propagated via Network Time Protocol (NTP) or via manually setting the clock.  For symptom 1: All D9900 or D9901 chassis running a software version lower than 11-10, All D9900 or D9901 chassis containing an MFP and running a software version lower than 12-10, All D9902 chassis running a software version lower than 12-10,  and have NTP synchronisation is enabled 24 hours in advance of the leap second event right up to the leap second event are susceptible to the possibility of this occurring.  For symptom 2: All DCM running a software version lower than 16-10-00, configured to playout the STT table.  For symptom 3: All DCM versions configured for ad insertion.  Workaround: For symptom 1: Option #1: Disable NTP sync at least 1 day before the leap second event, till the event has passed. Option #2: Upgrade to the versions that resolve the issue: All D9900 or D9901 chassis not containing an MFP: 11-10-00 or higher All D9900 or D9901 chassis containing an MFP: 12-10-00 or higher All D9902 chassis: 12-10-00 or higher  For symptom 2:  Option #1: Modify for each IO board the GPS_UTC_Offset; it can be changed on the default Settings / PSI Components page in the GUI. The current default value is 15s; the value after the leap second event should be 17s. Option #2: Upgrade to version 16-10-00 or higher  For symptom 3: Avoid scheduling ad inserts within 60 seconds of the leap second occurrence.

The only known way to start this process is for the following  conditions to be true:  - 'service internal' is enabled on the device - The 'socktest' command is run on the CLI  Workaround: Do not enable 'service internal' and/or do not run the 'socktest' command.  Further Problem Description: The 'service internal' command permits access to a number of debug and test commands which are not intended for use in production and may cause unexpected  behavior. It is therefore considered a best practice to disable 'service internal' unless it is needed for a specific reason.

Additional information on Cisco's security vulnerability policy can be found at the following URL:  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_policy.html  ","Customer FIRST DATA (FDC) observed a reboot of an ASR1006 running 15.3(3)S6 due to a crash in the SOCK TCP Test Server process.From source code, this process would be running only if the 'socktest' command was run on the CLI. The customer has 'service internal' enabled (which unlocks 'socktest') but have no recollection or record of having run the 'socktest' command. Nonetheless, the process was most certainly running at the time where it crashed.Based on the crash, the exception occurred after init_server() was passed an impossibly large value for the num_conn variable. The code does no error checking on this value - it blindly uses it to loop over an array and so - in this case - walks off the end of invalid memory.Additionally, an argument should be made as to whether this command even should still exist as it allows for any authenticated user to open arbitrary TCP sockets to/from IOS. While it is ;protected; under service internal, this still has security implications."," PSIRT-owner: psirt@cisco.com           This issue has been evaluated and driven to closure by PSIRT.

This is causing various issues with web browsers:-The frame content is not secured, whereas the frame container (ISE Portal) is using HTTPS: As the original URL you try to access might not use https protocol, when you are redirected, the browser will need to display http content into an https frame container and this might fail. Enabling ?mixed mode? without prompt in internet explorer will solve the problem.-The ISE Portal redirect to the WLC Portal in https (this can be disabled by config network secureweb disable). If the WLC Certificate is not trusted, the browser might simply not accept that. Once the WLC Certificate was installed into the computer trusted Root CA store, Internet explorer was redirecting to Google, but the 3rd issue arose:-Some website may indicate to the browser it should not display the content into a frame for security reasons, by using the header option X-Frame-Options: Deny or Same-Origin (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc288472(v=vs.85).aspx ). For example, Facebook and Google.com specify this in their header, and there is nothing we can do about that.I open this bug to track if there's any improvement we can make on the Redir.html page to make it compatible with browsers.I have a few idea, for what they worth:-Use Javascript (AJAX) to access the redirect_url, and show the fetched content into the current window using DOM or just redirect back.-Send the data via POST instead of GET"," PSIRT-owner: psirt@cisco.com           This issue has been evaluated by PSIRT and does not meet the criteria for PSIRT ownership or involvement.

CSC.sys,all,voice-callcontrol,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCve60402,Crash in Voice DNIS SNMP code," Symptom: The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subsystem of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software contains multiple vulnerabilities that could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to remotely execute code on an affected system or cause an affected system to reload. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected system via IPv4 or IPv6. Only traffic directed to an affected system can be used to exploit these vulnerabilities.  The vulnerabilities are due to a buffer overflow condition in the SNMP subsystem of the affected software. The vulnerabilities affect all versions of SNMP Versions 1, 2c, and 3. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 2c or earlier, the attacker must know the SNMP read-only community string for the affected system. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 3, the attacker must have user credentials for the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the affected system or cause the affected system to reload.  Cisco will release software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  The advisory is available at the following link: https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170629-snmp  Conditions: Devices running an affected version of Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software.  Workaround: Administrators are advised to allow only trusted users to have SNMP access on an affected system. Administrators are also advised to monitor affected systems by using the show snmp host command in the CLI.  In addition, administrators can mitigate these vulnerabilities by disabling the following MIBs on a device:      ADSL-LINE-MIB     ALPS-MIB     CISCO-ADSL-DMT-LINE-MIB     CISCO-BSTUN-MIB     CISCO-MAC-AUTH-BYPASS-MIB     CISCO-SLB-EXT-MIB     CISCO-VOICE-DNIS-MIB     CISCO-VOICE-NUMBER-EXPANSION-MIB     TN3270E-RT-MIB  To create or update a view entry and disable the affected MIBs, administrators can use the snmp-server view global configuration command, as shown in the following example:      snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP iso included     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP internet included     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP snmpUsmMIB excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP snmpVacmMIB excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP snmpCommunityMIB excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoMgmt.252 excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP transmission.94 excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP mib-2.34.9 excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoMgmt.35 excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoMgmt.95 excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoMgmt.130 excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoMgmt.219 excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoMgmt.254 excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoMabMIB excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoExperiment.997 excluded  To then apply this configuration to a community string, administrators can use the following command:       snmp-server community mycomm view NO_BAD_SNMP RO  For SNMP Version 3, administrators can use the following command:       snmp-server group v3group auth read NO_BAD_SNMP write NO_BAD_SNMP  Further Problem Description: Customer are advised to utilize the Cisco IOS Software Checker or Contact Cisco TAC to determine if fixed software has been released for an affected platform.

Additional information on Cisco's security vulnerability policy can be found at the following URL: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_policy.html  ","It is possible to reliably crash a router by sending it a single packet. This sender only needs to know the snmp community read string. The crash can be triggered by issuing the following command on any system that supports the snmpget program:snmpget -v2c -c <read-pwd> <address> `python -c ;print '1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.219.1.1.1.1.2%s'%('.1'*100);`The crash is caused by a overflowing a stack variable, potentially allowing an attacker to gain control of the cpu program counter. I have recreated the crash as far back as 15.0(1)M. This crash does not require any voice configuration, the feature need only be present in the image. A datak9 license does need to be installed on the system.The crash occurs because the function k_cvDnisMappingEntry_get() in sr_voicednismib.c creates a 65 byte buffer on the stack, and then blindly copies however many bytes are specified in the incoming request. I count 34 instances of this bad logic in the ss.comp1/uc_infra/src/voip directory. All of these callers to strncpy must validate that the length specified in the OID is less than the length of the destination buffer before doing the copy."," PSIRT-owner: psirt@cisco.com           This issue has been evaluated by PSIRT and does not meet the criteria for PSIRT ownership or involvement.

If VoIP applications are in use but the supplicants support CCKM (for example, Cisco Wireless Phones) - you can disable 11r support and reconfigure the clients to use CCKM (Cisco Centralized Key Management), which should provide a similar roaming experience.  NOTE: Disabling 11r support may have negative performance and availability impact on the network. Customers should verify that disabling 11r would not negatively impact their environment before performing such configuration change on their infrastructure devices.

These vulnerabilities occur in the processing of specific Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Secure HTTP (HTTPS), Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) traffic. If verbose logging is enabled for debugging purposes, a vulnerability exists when the FWSM processes packets destined to itself. All of these vulnerabilities may result in a reload of the device.  An additional vulnerability is included in this advisory in which the manipulation of access control lists (ACLs) that make use of object groups may corrupt the ACL and create a situation where unwanted traffic may be permitted or desirable traffic may be blocked.

Conditions: Device configured with default configuration.  Workaround: Not applicable or available.   Further Problem Description: This issue was found during an internal security audit of the product. This issue should not be made public as it is an internal hardening issue to be considered for integration.,"Currently Finesse does not implement any protective measures against click-jacking. PSB Requirement: SEC-WEB-CLCKJACK - Use anti-clickjacking measuresConditions: RECOMMENDEDHTTP The application SHOULD put in place anti-clickjacking (UI redress attack) defenses by ensuring the current frame is the top-most window, and/or specify X-FRAME-OPTIONS in the response.Click-jacking is where an attacker uses a transparent or opaque layer placed over the top of a page that has been embedded within an iframe in order to trick the user into clicking a button or link ortyping in text.By using a careful combination of stylesheets and iframes attackers can trick users into performing one-click actions such as deleting user accounts or submitting forms.For more information about this new type of attack, please refer to the following whitepaper for a technical description:http://www.contextis.com/files/Browser_Timing_Attacks.pdfAnti-click-jacking JavaScript code should be implemented on every page for legacy browser support. The following is an example of JavaScript code that will break out of an iframe:<script>if (self == top) {var theBody =document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0];theBody.style.display = ;block;;} else {top.location = self.location;}</script>Additionally, the X-Frame-Options header (X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN) should be specified with each request for newer browsers (supported list can be found here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTTP/X-Frame- Options), which will completely prevent the loading of a page within an Iframe that has been hosted on a different domain.Note: The X-Frame-Options header can also be used to specify certain trusted sources/sites that are allowed to embed the web pages in question in an iframe.

CSC.sys,all,rcp,customer-use,4,0,0,CSCdj72128,"transport input telnet, not rlogin, regulates rsh"," Symptom: Unable to execute commands over rsh after enabling ""transport input rlogin"". However, if ""trasnport input telnet"" is configured, the user can succesfully execute commands over rsh.  Conditions: After configuring one or more ""ip rcmd remote-host"" commands and configuring  ""transport input rlogin"" under line configuration, user is unable to execute rsh  commands on an IOS device. The ability to execute rsh commands is, contrary to what one would think, regulated by the ""transport input telnet"" command, not the ""transport input rlogin"" command. In order to enable rsh-style command execution on a Cisco IOS device, both the ""ip rcmd remote-host"" command has to be configured, and ""transport input telnet""  should be configured on the device lines.  This has the side effect of also enabling telnet to the device - while the customer might not want to enable telnet.  Workaround: Configure both ""ip rcmd remote-host"" commands as required, and ""transport input telnet"" under the line configuration. For customers looking to enable only rsh command execution, but not telnet, an access-class can be applied to the appropriate lines in order to permit only rsh but not telnet. Example:  line vty 0 4   access-class 123 in   transport input telnet ssh  access-list 123 permit tcp host address any eq 22 access-list 123 permit tcp host address any eq cmd access-list 123 deny ip any any  Further Problem Description: Command execution on Cisco IOS devices using rsh is highly discouraged. RSH uses a weak authentication mechanism (only user name is required) and traffic isn't kept confidential by using encryption. SSH is the preferred replacement to RSH.  Customers are also advised to review the ""Management Plane"" section of the document entitled ""Cisco Guide to Harden Cisco IOS Devices"" for additional recommendations to secure management connections to Cisco IOS devices.

These ports are used to serve various functions associated with a distributed deployment environment (with two or more ACS servers) and external API functionality. These ports should only be open when explicitly configured by an administrator or when the ACS is configured to be in a distributed deployment environment.RMI is a framework that allows two machines to share and interact with Java objects over the network. The ACS servers in a distributed environment use RMI to perform remote actions on their peer's objects. Sybase is the underlying database for ACS where all ACS data is kept. TCP/2638 provides direct access to the Sybase database, and ACS server peers use it to perform full replication of the ACS database. ActiveMQ is used to send incremental database updates between a Primary and Secondary ACS server. Syslog is used to send syslog messages between the Secondary and Primary ACS servers. Exposing these services to the network when not needed needlessly increases the server's attack surface.Ideally, TCP ports 2020 and 2030 would only be open when RMI is needed, and TCP/61616, UDP/20514 would only be open in a distributed deployment environment. TCP/2638 would more restrictively only be opened on a transactional basis when one ACS server needs access to another ACS server's database. EDCS-1122982 identifies steps that can be taken to secure communication over these ports once they are open."," PSIRT-owner: psirt@cisco.com           This issue has been evaluated and driven to closure by PSIRT.

Additional information on Cisco's security vulnerability policy can be found at the following URL:  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_policy.html  ","Issue descriptionIt might be possible for a web page controlled by an attacker to load the content of this response within an iframe on the attacker's page. This may enable a ;clickjacking; attack, in which the attacker's page overlays the target application's interface with a different interface provided by the attacker. By inducing victim users to perform actions such as mouse clicks and keystrokes, the attacker can cause them to unwittingly carry out actions within the application that is being targeted. This technique allows the attacker to circumvent defenses against cross-site request forgery, and may result in unauthorized actions.Note that this issue is being reported because the application's response does not set a suitable X-Frame-Options header in order to prevent framing attacks. Some applications attempt to prevent these attacks from within the HTML page itself, using ;framebusting; code. However, this type of defense is normally ineffective and can usually be circumvented by a skilled attacker.Issue remediationYou should review the application functions that are accessible from within the response, and determine whether they can be used by application users to perform any sensitive actions within the application. If so, then a framing attack targeting this response may result in unauthorized actions.To effectively prevent framing attacks, the application should return a response header with the name X-Frame-Options and the value DENY to prevent framing altogether, or the value SAMEORIGIN to allow framing only by pages on the same origin as the response itself.

CSC.spv.ipvs.dmn,pnc,server-sw,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCus27991,PNC PowerVu configuration related to PowerVu Security concern," Symptoms: Cisco recently learned that a group of C-band enthusiasts had launched an initiative  to compromise PowerVu programming. This document provides details of recommended  actions to mitigate this threat and reduce the potential attack profile of the service. We  recommend the following temporary measures be implemented immediately.  Conditions: Device running with default configuration running an affected version of software.  Workaround: Temporary EMM Suspension : Set Install flag = No. To preserve the current IRD Installed state, Issue a search for all IRDs with Installed=No and save info via File-Save As.   Repeat for Installed=Disabled.  Alternatively, issue a search for all IRDs with Installed=No (and Disabled) then  initiate global change to record change.   To disable EMM transmission initiate global change against *entire* IRD database and set Installed=No   If IRD authorization control is needed, temporarily set Install back to Yes.   Return back to Install=No as soon as possible. Secure Transport Assign a random number of unused tier bits to all IRDs, within *each* of the three ranges highlighted below.   Notes, 1.      Tier bit merge operation against the entire database is a lengthy operation. 2.      We do not support global change tier removal.  Contact Cisco for support.  To determine if you already have tiers assigned within the 3 ranges, initiate a tier range search.     In the example above, we are searching the database for all IRDs that have one of the highlighted  tiers bits assigned.  You can search for a maximum of 20 tiers at a time (ANY OF criteria). If operational tiers are already in use, within the 3 ranges, there is no need to assign random tiers.  Here is an example of how to correctly assign the random tier bits, within *all* three ranges.   Here is an incorrect example (see below).  Tiers are placed in the first range, missing in the second and third ranges.  Extraneous tier bit 127  specified.  Blackout Code assignments if not used already: Also assign 1 unused Blackout code to any IRD that does not have any codes assigned.   Place code in Blackout Code 1 field.  To search for these unit, see search filter defined below   In the example below, a random blackout code 56789 is assigned to all implicated IRDs, via Global Change.  Resume  EMM Transmission : Set Install flag = Yes. Once the above steps are taken, normal operation can resume.   Return applicable IRDs to Install = Yes or Disabled.   Multi-Session Key (MSK) Update While not a part of this specific process, we recommend regular updates of the MSK to protect your security.  Refer to the PNC manual.   The Multi-Session Key is one of the layers in protecting the transport.   Changing it on a regular basis is strongly recommended.     Changing the MSK can be network wide disruptive so please ensure you are familiar with the process  before attempting an update/switch of MSKs.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of command arguments to the CLI parser. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting crafted command arguments into a vulnerable CLI command and gain unauthorized access to the underlying operating system of the device.  An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands at the users privilege level.  Note: On products that support multiple Virtual Device Contexts (VDC) this could allow an attacker to execute commands at the users privilege level outside of the users environment.

When the ASASM is in multi-context mode, the broadcast packet may be sent back to the ASASM  and loop indefinitely unless some mitigation (such as TTL decrement) is applied.

Symptoms of CSCvg29487 include: - Slow accumulation of 1048576 byte blocks of memory (viewable in 'show memory detail')  Symptoms of CSCvg25763 include: - Traffic denied by the ASA despite an ACL policy permitting the traffic - Traffic permitted by the ASA despite an ACL policy denying the traffic  Conditions: This issue occurs during access-list compilation (due to changes in the configuration done by a user or dynamic due to the use of FQDN based policies).

And user will have trouble calling the Admin desk and figure it out.     So,  point is why can't we just enable the HSTS on the headend. So, it pushes the HSTS header and from there it internal redirect and any subsequent request to http to https will be redirected locally. 2)      Enabling the HTTP redirect will solve the above problem but.For every HTTP request redirect take 120 ms to redirect it, if we use HSTS we reduce it to 0.6 ms. 3)      While generating the reports to check the strength of the portal, we get the low score due to HSTS not enabled on the portal.

In the data pipeline, CP TCP proxy is performed before SVC and SVC is performed before tcpmod.  The problem occurs when CP TCP proxy modifies data that have been forwarded to and queued in tcpmod. The unanticipated modification corrupts state information (specifically TCP sliding window) maintained by tcpmod.  The tcpmod eventually crash when the corrupted state information is used.  Enabling compression causes SVC to perform a packet copy received from CP TCP proxy before forwarding to tcpmod. Since a copy of the packet is forwarded, the ""unanticipated modification"" is done to the released packet and not to the packet queued in tcpmod.","Customer upgraded his asa from 8.0(3) to 8.0(3.19), but soon the asa crash with ThreadName Dispatch Unit.Bug only seen with customers using AnyConnect"," PSIRT-owner: elparis@cisco.com  This issue has been evaluated by PSIRT and does not meet the criteria for PSIRT ownership or involvement.

CSC.netbu,pix-asa,vpn,customer-use,3,0,0,CSCse36327,GRE Packets are no longer encrypted and are sent out in the clear," Symptom:  Unable to encrypt packets on the ASA or PIX running version 7.x  Conditions:  The IPSEC tunnel was previously working and either one of the following events occured:  1.  the crypto map and/or isakmp has been removed and reapplied to the interface 2. the PIX/ASA is upgraded from version 6.x to version 7.x 3.  the PIX/ASA is rebooted 4. The remote IPSEC peer/s is rebooted  All events except 1 occur when a dynamic crypto map is used without a match address statement.  This typically affects only GRE traffic.  Workaround:  On PIX/ASA 7.x:  - For a dynamic crypto map, use a match address statement for the GRE traffic. - If the crypto map and/or isakmp is removed and reapplied, perform a ""clear local-host"" after that.  On PIX/ASA 8.0.2 or above:  Issue 'sysopt connection reclassify-vpn' (save the config) and re-establish any existing tunnels.  Further Problem Description  In PIX/ASA 7.x, GRE encryption may stop working (GRE packets are sent in clear) after removing and reapplying the encryption.  This behaviour is by design in 7.x.  If encryption is disabled but GRE packets are coming to the PIX in this time, GRE session is created on the PIX and marked as clear-text one (""do not encrypt"").  When encryption is applied back, non-encrypted GRE session still exists on PIX and GRE packets that should be encrypted still bypass crypto map until old session is timed out or deleted.   If there is a dynamic routing (OSPF/EIGRP/etc) running over GRE, this GRE session may never timeout and should be cleared manually.  In PIX/ASA 8.0.2, new functionality was introduced with new CLI command: ""sysopt connection reclassify-vpn"".  Default state is disabled.  If this command is enabled, then enabling encryption causes non-encryption sessions to be dropped and reestablished with encryption.",Unable to encyrpt packet when the crypto map and/or isakmp is removed and reapplied to the interface.For more information refer to the attachment - output_from_PIX, PSIRT-owner: dciccaro  A PSIRT Security Advisory will not be released for this defect.

Conditions: Jabber tries to log in  through Expressway using the normal SASL mechanisms. Due to an internal issue no SASL mechanisms are returned to Jabber With no SASL mechanisms, Jabber should fail the login (as other XMPP clients do). Jabber instead tries to use an obsolete XMPP authentication protocol instead - XEP-0078 even though support for this protocol has not been advertised IM&P returns a successful response, with neither of the two know mechanisms (password or digest) listed as IM&P does not support them Jabber should not proceed further as no mechanisms have been returned, but instead sends in the plain text password  Workaround: None  Further Problem Description:  ","Scenario:1.	Jabber tries to log in using the normal SASL mechanisms.o	But due to an internal issue no SASL mechanisms are returned to the Jabber client (as you observed)2.	With no SASL mechanisms, Jabber should fail the login (as other XMPP clients do).o	However, Jabber instead tries to use an obsolete XMPP authentication protocol instead - XEP-0078: http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0078.htmlo	It does this despite the fact that IM&P/Expressway does not advertise any support for XEP-078o	In doing so, it sends in the plain text password.o	A separate defect (CSCuu04196) has been opened to address this.3.

CSC.embu,ncs,swim,customer-use,3,0,0,CSCvc60031,Cisco Prime Infrastructure Information Disclosure Vulnerability," Symptom: A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI) and Cisco Evolved  Programmable Network Manager (EPNM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access  sensitive data. The attacker does not need to have administrator credentials and could use this  information to conduct additional reconnaissance attacks.  The vulnerability is due to the application not sufficiently protecting sensitive data when  responding to a HTTP request to the web interface. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability  by sending a crafted HTTP protocol to the targeted application. An exploit could allow the  attacker to find out sensitive information about the application.  Conditions: The device running with default configuration running an affected version of software.  Workaround: None.  Further Problem Description: None.  PSIRT Evaluation: The Cisco PSIRT has assigned this bug the following CVSS version 3 score. The Base CVSS score as of the time of evaluation is 6.5: https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N/E:X/RL:X/RC:X  CVE ID CVE-2017-3884 has been assigned to document this issue.  Additional information on Cisco's security vulnerability policy can be found at the following URL: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_policy.html  ","An underprivileged user can steal CCO credentials stored on a Prime Infrastructure (and presumably EPNM) server.  CCO credentials were once input to the server (for example, to fetch software updates for the server or software images for devices) can be stolen.  The attacker may be a lobby ambassador or system monitoring user, which normally would not have access to input CCO credentials, let alone access stored credentials (the password should not be retrievable by an end-user anyway).Attack:1. Login as underprivileged user (for example, lobby ambassador or system monitoring)2. GET /webacs/rs/preferences/system/default.swim/CCOUserName3.

CSC.content-security,wsa,adaptive_scanning,customer-use,3,0,0,CSCvc76500,Evaluate ESA CSCvb91473 for WSA : Attachment policy bypass in Cisco Ironport," Symptom: A vulnerability in the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) scanner of Cisco AsyncOS Software  for Cisco Email Security Appliances (ESA) and Web Security Appliances  (WSA) could allow an unauthenticated,  remote attacker to bypass configured user filters on the device.  The vulnerability is due to improper error handling of a malformed MIME header in an email attachment.  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an email with a crafted MIME attachment. For example,  a successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured user filters to prevent executable files from being opened. The malformed MIME headers may not be RFC compliant but some mail clients could still allow  users to access the attachment, which may not have been properly filtered by the device.  Conditions: This vulnerability affects all releases prior to the first fixed release of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco ESA and  WSA, both virtual and hardware appliances, that are configured with message or content filters to scan incoming email attachments on the ESA or services scanning content of web access on the WSA.  Workaround: None.  Further Problem Description: Message Filter Rule to Detect Malformed MIME Headers on the ESA Product  You can now take actions on messages with malformed MIME headers using the new message filter rule malformed-header.

Additional information on Cisco's security vulnerability policy can be found at the following URL: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_policy.html  ","Hi, We have discovered that it is possible to bypass attachment policies in the Cisco Ironport product (we are using version 10.0.0.-203). By having multiple Content-type's where one of them is multipart/mixed, Ironport lets mail through, apparently without noticing that an attachment is preset. Our mail client software shows the attachment in a mail received via Ironport. Since the attachment isn't identified as such, it never triggers the Ironport content rules in place (no windows executable policy) and it is therefore possible to deliver any type of file to the recipient this way. Having multiple content types is probably in violation of some MIME/SMTP RFC's so technically Ironport could be correct here by not identifying an attachment but we feel it should then be rejected or at least having the option to block this kind of message. We have tested with two separate mail clients and both display the attachment to the recipient. Here is the the first part of a mail conversation where the executable putty.exe is sent this way (the external Ironport here forwards it to internal servers): (See attachment for Big Description)"," PSIRT-owner: psirt@cisco.com           This issue has been evaluated by PSIRT and does not meet the criteria for PSIRT ownership or involvement.

CSC.netbu,pix-asa,pki-crl,customer-use,6,0,0,CSCtb41710,ASA revocation-check to fall back to none only if CDP is unavailable," Symptom: When the ASA does not have the CRL cached, the first client authentication/certificate validation will trigger a CRL download, although if the CRL retrieval is a bit delayed [~600ms], CRL retrieval goes to the background, and the revocation-check falls back to none. i.e. a revoked certificate is allowed if the ASA does not have the CRL cached. The CRL retrieval succeeds in the background, and the CRL is cached. And this blocks the subsequent certificates that are already revoked.    This symptom repeats when the CRL validity/cache expires.  Conditions: ASA acting as SSLVPN or IPSec Server, where the peer/client is authenticated using certificates. Client CA trust-point on the ASA has ''revocation-check crl none''  Workaround: 1. Configure ""revocation-check crl"" under the trustpoint and make sure that the CDP is always reachable.  or   2. If ""revocation-check crl none"" is the preferred configuration, then deploy the CDP as close to the ASA as possible:   - If the CDP is far off, deploy an HTTP server as close to the ASA as possible, and on this server, have a script that downloads the CRL file from the official CDP on a periodic basis.   - Use this CDP instead of the embedded CDP from the certificate:  Ex:   crypto pki trustpoi TP     crl configure       policy static       url 1 the new CRL location  Further Problem Description: Caching the CRL for the shorter duration increases the risk of allowing clients with revoked certificates.

Requirement: If a Product is shipped bundled with supporting software, such as an operating system,  database manager, or HTTP server, any features or Services of the supporting software which is  non-essential for operation of the Product MUST be removed or disabled.  Status: Current  Justification: Unnecessary services may have dangerous security holes.  Such holes are especially  insidious because administrators may not realize that unused services are enabled at all.  Document References:  Implementation Guidelines:  The complete removal of the software implementing any nonessential and  unsupported services has the advantage that if a miscreant gains access to the system they would first have to install the software in order to activate the service on the compromised system."

CSC.sys,all,bgp,customer-use,3,0,0,CSCsx73770,Invalid BGP formatted update causes peer reset with AS prepending,"   Symptom:      A Cisco IOS device that receives a BGP update message and as a result of AS  prepending needs to send an update downstream that would have over 255 AS hops  will send an invalid formatted update. This update when received by a  downstream BGP speaker triggers a NOTIFICATION back to the sender which results  in the BGP session being reset.      Conditions:      This problem is seen when a Cisco IOS device receives a BGP update and   due to a combination of either inbound, outbound, or both AS prepending it  needs to send an update downstream that has more than 255 AS hops.      Workaround:      The workaround is to implement  bgp maxas-limit X No on the  device that after prepending would need to send an update with over 255 AS  hops. Since IOS limits the route-map prepending value to 10 the most that  could be added is 21 AS hops (10 on ingress, 10 on egress, and 1 for normal  eBGP AS hop addition). Therefore, a conservative value to configure would be  200 to prevent this condition.            ","A BGP speaker out on the internet leaked an announcement that has in excess of 200 AS hops in it. In a situation where AS prepending was used along the update path such that a router received an update that was supposed to have more than 255 AS hops, the router would send a notification and reset the BGP session. The router should have processed that update correctly and not reset the session."," PSIRT-owner: ckossmey             PSIRT has completed our investigation of this bug, has provided a publicly-available Release-note enclosure and has released the bug to customers via the Cisco Bug Toolkit.

This tool does not exploit a vulnerability in SSL/TLS but in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) encryption mode. This attack was originally identified by Gregory V. Bard in his paper ''A Challenging But Feasible Blockwise-Adaptive Chosen-Plaintext Attack On SSL'' available at http://eprint.iacr.org/2006/136.  This bug is to track and document the impact to this product.  Conditions: In order to be successful an attacker must be able to inject arbitrary packets for a vulnerable server to encrypt and the attacker must be able to intercept encrypted packets between the victim and the server.  While Cisco can implement existing workarounds they have a potential to break interoperability with many browsers that are currently in use. That would have severe negative impact on customers' productivity. For that reason Cisco will provide fix when a stable TLS 1.1 implementation becomes available.  In the mean time we strongly suggest that users upgrade their browsers and keep their operating systems patched. For this attack to succeed an attacker must be able to execute an arbitrary code on the client. By preventing the code to be executed we can prevent this vulnerability to be exploited.  Workaround: Not available.   PSIRT Evaluation: The Cisco PSIRT has assigned this bug the following CVSS version 2 score.

The vulnerability is due an inefficient handling of TCP sockets within the WAAS kernel while handling the incoming HTTP traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending high volume of crafted HTTP traffic through the WAAS device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition by triggering a kernel reload of the WAAS.  PSIRT Evaluation: The Cisco PSIRT has assigned this bug the following CVSS version 2 score.

This  traffic is called non-pattable.  * Versions before 15.5(3)S4 create a half-entry for this kind of traffic, which results in a security    vulnerability as the half entries allow outside-to-inside traffic to be translated.  * Versions after 15.5(3)S4 avoid the creation of this half-entry and eliminate the vulnerability    because this kind of traffic is dropped.  Conditions: Dynamic NAT rule in place. Non-Pattable traffic (anything other than TCP, UDP and ICMP) traverses from inside to outside.  Workaround: If the non-pattable traffic is to be dropped the user should configure the ''ip nat settings nonpatdrop'' command which is availble from 15.5(3)S4 release onwards.   If the non-pottable traffic is to be forwarded the user would configure ''no ip nat settings nonpatdrop'' which is the default.

Conditions: UDP port 2152 is associated with GPRS Tunneling Protocol. GPRS was introduced on XE3.4S.  http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/sec_data_zbf/configuration/xe-3s/sec-data-zbf-xe-book/conf-gprs-tunn-prot.html#GUID-6153DF03-6228-4117-8E71- 80989510E3A5  By default this port is open even without any GPRS configurations. There is currently no way to manually close the port or disable the service if its not needed.  Workaround: An extended ACL can be created and applied to the interface to block destination UDP port 2152. You can also use control-plane policing to block UDP packets being sent with a destination port of 2152 and being sent to the control plane. Here is the example config to do this:  ip access-list extended udp-port-2152 permit udp any any eq 2152  class-map match-all traffic-udp-port-2152 match access-group name udp-port-2152  policy-map CoPP class traffic-udp-port-2152 police cir 32000 conform-action drop exceed-action drop  control-plane service-policy input CoPP  Please note the previous configuration should only be applied to devices NOT configured to process GPRS traffic.

He did not make any config changes. Once he upgraded, customer ran an NMAP testing against the device and found that port 2152 is open by default and doesn't offer an configurable option to close the port without the deployment of an ingress access-list. Since UDP port 2152 is open by default, the device could potentially accept these packets without customer knowledge.We have a possible workaround which is to apply an ALC that blocks destination UDP port 2152 but this might be difficult because there is a large amount of interfaces involved. It would be much easier if we were able to simply close the port / disable the service manually if not needed or have it disabled by default until GPRS is actually configured. If we go the route where the port is disabled by default until GPRS is configured, we would also have to make sure its disabled again once the config is removed."," PSIRT-owner: psirt@cisco.com  This issue has been evaluated and driven to closure by PSIRT.

It is possible to perform brute DoS attack which will cause ESA to have a lot of opened sockets.   As the result gui is unaccessible, some apps will cease to work responding with error '[Errno 24] Too many open files'.  Maybe it wouldn't be an issue if it caused by a legitimate user as the result of some manipulations etc.  But, suppose it's a serious issue, considering that fact that it can be done relatively quickly - ~2 hours from one machine against one ESA appliance.  An attacker shouldn't have any credentials etc. It is enough to have possibility to connect to port 443, like 'openssl s_client -connect esa_target.qa:443'. (I don't know what timeout value is configured on ESA by default, suppose that TLS connection to port 443 is designated as active for 2 hours???)

For further information, send a message to psirt@cisco.com.  (jklimarc-03/30/15)  Symptom: Whenever a user requests a call forwarding service on the IP Phone, the phone sends various messages (incoming transactions) throughout the Local Area Network to the main system that provides the interface moves and changes (VOSS Platform). All these messages can be readily available to an attacker, for example, a malicious insider via a brute force attempt, with the correct network capture tools at his disposal.  There is nothing which can be done on the platform to block this type of brute force attack due to the fact that it is a URL which Unified Service Monitor (VOSS) responds to. This issue has been logged as VOSS  ;Bug 20855 ? LBG HUCS: Insufficient authentication on incoming transactions for call forwarding. ;  Description of Effect  If there are any controls inside LBG that rely on confidentiality of phone calls, then a malicious insider (or anyone with access to the LBG corporate network) can set up call forwarding and intercept the calls. For example, he/she can set up forwarding to an external phone, for example, a special voicemail which plays the original user&apos;s voicemail message to make it more believable.

CSC.sys,c2911,isr-g2-sw,customer-use,3,0,0,CSCuc60933,CSCtx96997 fix does not work," Symptoms: The Cisco ISR G2 routers have a second core on the CPU which is for the Embedded Services  Engine. To allow connections to this Embedded Services Engine a new line is defined in the config  as line 2. Before the fix of CSCtx96997 this line was always enabled:  line 2  no activation-character  no exec  transport preferred none  transport input all  transport output pad telnet rlogin lapb-ta mop udptn v120 ssh  stopbits 1  If transport input none was configured for this line upon a reload the transport input all command  would appear again. CSCtx96997 changed this behavior. If the second core if the CPU was disabled  then no transport input config would show up under line 2. If the second core was enabled then the  transport input all command would always be added to the configuration.   Instead the fix for CSCtx96997 does the opposite. If the second core is disabled then transport input  all will always be added to the config for line 2.  Conditions: This behavior happens on the Cisco ISR G2 routers with the fix for CSCtx96997.   Workaround: After the router boots the desired configuration for line two can be applied again. Even with transport  input all configured if there is no IP address for the Embedded Services Engine a connection cannot  be established:  Cisco2901#service-module embedded-Service-Engine 0/0 session IP address needs to be configured on interface Embedded-Service-Engine0/0  If an IP address is defined, but the interface for the Embedded Services Engine is administratively  shutdown then the connection will simply time out:  Cisco2901#service-module embedded-Service-Engine 0/0 session Trying 192.168.1.1, 2002 ...  % Connection timed out; remote host not responding ",Without the fix for CSCtx96997 the line 2 would always have transport input all configured. This fix was to always configure transport input all under this line if the second core was enabled. If the second core was disabled then the transport input config would not show up under line 2. In the unit test and in the lab we can see the logic used is backwards:!     /*!      * Set the 'transport input all' only if!      * 2nd Core is enabled.!      */!     if (!hw_resources->enable_2_c) {!         tty->transport_allowin = CONN_TRANSPORT_ALL;!     } else {!         tty->transport_allowin = 0;! If enable_2_c is 0 or disabled then we add in transport input all. If the second core is enabled then we fall to the else and remove transport input.

CSC.sys,3750,hardware,customer-use,1,0,0,CSCeb73685,CPU Queue Lockup with jumbo frames," Symptom: If jumbo frame is enabled on the Cat3750 switch using the ""system mtu  jumbo size"" global configuration command, sending back-to-back large packets in excess of 1782 bytes to the CPU may cause the CPU receive  queues to lock up. As a result, the Cat3750 CPU cannot receive data from  the outside world, although the switch may continue to forward traffic  between its network ports. When this problem occurs, the console of the  Cat3750 switch will hang, and the following message may be seen  repeatedly in the syslog:  %SUPQ-4-CPUHB_RECV_STARVE: Still seeing receive queue stuck after throttling  In addition, since the CPU is no longer receiving control protocol packets  such as STP BPDUs, it may put all ports into forwarding state. This could  create loops in the network, and cause broadcast storms and network outage.  When the CPU queues are locked up, the user will not be able to issue  commands to reload the switch via CLI or SNMP. The only way to recover  is to power cycle the Cat3750 switch which is no longer responding to  user commands.  Workaround: Do NOT configure jumbo frame size  1782 bytes on the Cat3750 switch  running IOS release 12.1(14)EA1 or a lower version.

Set up CUP and openAM to enable SSO2. Make sure SSLv2 protocol has been disabled on openAM3. Do the required configuration for openAM PKI CAC SSO4. Start the wireshark packet capture from openAM5. From OS Administration -- > Security --> Single Sign On, try to enable the single sign on for any webapp6. A security Trust error will be thrown on the page7. Analyze the wireshark packet capture by decoding the TCP packets to SSL. 8. The initial client hello message from CUP will be sent over SSLv2 protocol.As SSLv2 protocol is disabled on openAM the TLS negotiation has failed with openAM server.The same issue can be seen on LDAP Authentication also if SSLv2 is disabled on Active Directory server.If LDAP authentication with SSL is enabled on CUCM and when ldap synced users try to login to cup webapps or Jabber, the authentication request to AD server will fail as cup won't be able to successfully establish TLS connection with AD server."," PSIRT-owner: psirt@cisco.com           This issue has been evaluated and driven to closure by PSIRT.

CSC.sys,all,tcp,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCed27956,TCP checks should verify ack sequence number,"     A vulnerability in the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) specification    (RFC793) has been discovered by an external researcher. The successful    exploitation enables an adversary to reset any established TCP connection in a    much shorter time than was previously discussed publicly. Depending on the    application, the connection may get automatically re-established. In other    cases, a user will have to repeat the action (for example, open a new Telnet or    SSH session). Depending upon the attacked protocol, a successful attack may    have additional consequences beyond terminated connection which must be    considered. This attack vector is only applicable to the sessions which are    terminating on a device (such as a router, switch, or computer) and not to the    sessions that are only passing through the device (for example, transit traffic    that is being routed by a router). In addition, this attack vector does not    directly compromise data integrity or confidentiality.        All Cisco products which contain TCP stack are susceptible to this vulnerability.        This advisory is available at    http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20040420-tcp-ios.shtml , and it    describes this vulnerability as it applies to Cisco products that run Cisco    IOS software.        A companion advisory that describes this vulnerability for products that do not    run Cisco IOS software is available at    http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20040420-tcp-nonios.shtml     ION is also impacted.               ","An outside researcher has determined that given the following information, is should be possible to reset an existing TCP connection. The first 4 are simple to determine or guess, and due to rules around TCP windowing the fifth, sequence number, should be much simpler than initially thought.      *) source IP address (easy to find with traceroute)      *) destination IP address (easy to find with traceroute)      *) source port (semi-obfuscated)      *) destination port (well known in most cases)      *) sequence number      Source and destination IP addresses should not be a problem. Source     and destination ports are a bit of the issue. One side is certainly     listening to some fixed port (173, 23, 25, whatever) and the other     is listening to some high port. Sequence number must be guessed but     only to fall within a TCP window. ACK sequence number is ignored     (managed to kill my Telnet session with ACK_seq=0x00). In summary     one would expect that one must run the same attack twice. First     time assuming that host A listens on a fixed port and then another     time where host B is listening on a fixed port (or one can do it     in parallel).     What can be done is to pay attention to ACK sequence number. If     attacker must guess it then the whole problem will be much harder.     RFC793 says this (page 37):     -----     Reset Processing       In all states except SYN-SENT, all reset (RST) segments are validated       by checking their SEQ-fields.  A reset is valid if its sequence number       is in the window.  In the SYN-SENT state (a RST received in response       to an initial SYN), the RST is acceptable if the ACK field       acknowledges the SYN.     ---     Since it is ;SEQ-fields; it looks as if we are not following the     letter of the RFC and checking only one SEQ-filed.

RTID #669974  This customer saw half a dozen lockups on their ESAs cause their network was blocking CASE updates.  When CASE updates are being blocked, the parl processes will run for an undefined period of time.  The problem with this, is that the parl processes have never had enforced memory limits on them.  Supposedly they are supposed to be killed off when they exceed 384MB, but in practice it doesn't work.  This customer had multiple ESAs, that were blocked off from updates, this results in the Parl processes no longer getting restarted regularly.  With the processes running for an undefined amount of time, their memory use would balloon out, and we seeing an average of around 480MB in use by each parl process.  (I know some of the memory is shared between parl processes).  We don't have enough memory on our ESA to allow parl processes to each use 500MB or so.  We typically don't file bugs for Parl memory use, as its problem with excessive memory use is usually addressed by killing the processes off every 5 minutes.  And CASE was designed to only need to run for about 5 minutes at a time.  When updates are no longer occurring, we run into trouble.  This is not the bug I want to file, I want to file a bug to enforce a memory limit on our parl processes.

Conditions:  This may happen when IOS automatically generates an RSA keypair to be used by another function, like the HTTPS server.  Workarounds:  In some versions of IOS it is possible to prevent IOS from enabling the SSH server when the default RSA keypair is generated by configuring the SSH server to use a specific, named RSA keypair. For example:  router(config)#ip ssh rsa keypair-name SSHKEY  Please create RSA keys to enable SSH. router(config)#crypto key generate rsa label SSHKEY modulus 1024 The name for the keys will be: SSHKEY  % The key modulus size is 1024 bits % Generating 1024 bit RSA keys, keys will be non-exportable...[OK]  router(config)# *Jan  9 11:30:28.119: %SSH-5-ENABLED: SSH 1.99 has been enabled  Further Information:  This bug is an enhancement request to have an explicit configuration knob to enable the SSH server in IOS.

So it is impossible to disable SSH on platforms where SSL is enabled by default (e.g. Cat3550 and Cat3750 switches).We should provide a CLI command to enable/disable SSH instead of relying onthe presence of the host RSA keys to determine whether SSH should be enabled. In addition, SSH should have the ability to generate its own keys if none exists.Perhaps there is a way to integrate the current and the new behavior so that by default it works like it works now. Then add a ;no ip ssh enable; to allow customers to generate a keypair without SSH being enabled.And ;ip ssh enable; would do both - generate a SSH specific keypair (even if another keypair exists) and enable SSH."," PSIRT-owner: elparis@cisco.com  This issue has been evaluated by PSIRT and does not meet the criteria for PSIRT ownership or involvement.

Further Problem Description:  ","I chose isr-g2-sw as the component because this affects the embedded services engine, the SRE modules, the etherswitch modules, etc. From all the documentation I can find (including the legacy documents for the older modules) they all say to access these different modules a user needs to connect to the router first. From there you can connect to the device using either:1) use the CLI service-module <int> session2) reverse telnet to the modules internal IP address. Both methods require the internal interface to be not only physically up, but also have an IP address configured. The problem though is all the modules can be accessed from outside the router. This happens even when the internal module IP address is not configured and the interface itself is shutdown. See the TAC-repro enclosure. I verified this happens on the latest available CCO release 15.3(2)T, but the problem happens on several older versions of code as well.Since we do not allow users to modify and save changes to the TTY lines created this makes the problem worse."," PSIRT-owner: psirt@cisco.com           This issue has been evaluated by PSIRT and does not meet the criteria for PSIRT ownership or involvement.

HSTS error may be seen when sponsor portal certificate has no matches in CN/SAN with Admin certificate.  For example -  Sponsor portal fqdn is - sponsor.example.net Sponsor portal certificate has CN/SAN - *.example.net Admin certificate has CN/SAN - *.example.com  During the first connection attempt to http://sponsor.example.net  user is redirected by ISE inside of http  connection to full portal url like https://sponsor.example.net:8447portal-id This connection works perfectly fine if user has correct certificates installed in the trusted store.  At the same time during this connection attempt ISE is forcing browser to use HSTS for all next connection  to the same FQDN.  When user tries to open http://sponsor.example.net again browser which supports HSTS forces https  connection to sponsor.example.net  as a result of this connection attempt Admin certificate is returned. As  per naming example described above this connection attempt is blocked with HSTS error.

Note that the pattern can occur in an iframe, so there is not necessarily any user-visible indication of what is happening, visiting any website would be enough.The extension uses nativeMessaging, so this magic string is enough for any website to execute arbitrary code (!!).The protocol the extension uses is complicated, using CustomEvent() objects to pass JSON messages between the webpage, the extension and the native code.Stepping through an initialization, a website must first request that the extension open a port for communication, like this:document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent(;connect;, { detail: { token: ;token; }})); // token can be any stringThen messages can passed to native code via ;message; events.

CSC.netbu,pix-asa,access-list,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCvg25763,Traffic incorrectly dropped or allowed when ACL changes under low-memory condition," Symptom: Making changes to an ACL under low memory conditions may cause the ACL compilation process to fail. When this occurs, the ASA removes the ACL changes, as well as the pre-existing content of the ACL, from the datapath of the ASA. This results in only the security-level assignments of the interfaces dictating what should be permitted or denied.  When compilation fails, an error is presented to the CLI session indicating a potential reason for the failure.  Conditions: This is seen when changes to the ACL are made under low system memory conditions or when the allocation of a specific subset of the firewall's memory is very high (1048576 byte binsizes of memory).   Please refer to Cisco Bug Id CSCvg29487 for information about an existing bug that causes a slow depletion of that specific memory.  Workaround: This issue occurs when the size of the ACL grows too large for memory or the available free memory on the platform is very low. If you do encounter this issue, try reducing the size of the ACLs or freeing up memory on the platform.

Additional information on Cisco's security vulnerability policy can be found at the following URL:  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_policy.html  ","This problem can be triggered by CSCvg29487 - FQDN (DNS) entries in nested objects in ACL caused memory leak and possible ACL corruptionIn a rare corner case, upon making changes to an ACL the change might fail and the system encounters a state where some of the ACL or the entire ACL is removed from the ASP permit domain table, and only the default security-level might remain. One possible result of this is that only the default security policy is in effect (based on security levels and the same-security interface policy). Re-applying the access-list to the interfaces might mitigate the problem.  It might take several tries of re-applying the ACL for it to take proper effect.The problem seems to be related to a low memory, or fragmented memory condition at the time that the ACL change is triggered. It has so far only been seen on ASAs with a non-low uptime (150+ days). The problem might be triggerd by an ACL change that is initiated by a manual ACL edit, or by an automatic ACL DNS entry refresh.On affected devices, it is observed that specific memory bin sizes have a huge number of allocations, so this is probably a leak situation, which we think we've reproduced in the TAC labs.Example: ASAv on 9.6(2)2:'show memory detail'      MEMPOOL_GLOBAL_SHARED POOL STATS:      ----- allocated memory statistics -----           1048576           363      380633088In our lab, we using the customer's configuration we also see allocations with that bin size increasing. We have so far not seen this problem occur on ASAs that do NOT have FQDN entries configured in ACLs.The TAC has reproduced this problem by instrumenting heavy memory usage ('debug menu memory 20') at the time that an ACL changes due to DNS entries refreshing.

The administrator should have an unrestricted choice of which TLS versions will be accepted in negotiation.Implementation Guidance:All TLS versions earlier than 1.1 are subject to the BEAST attack, provided that the attacker is in a position to generate sufficient chosen plaintext. Although this doesn't make those versions useless, it does weaken them.Implementations of HTTP over TLS are in a serious bind. The attack is worst against Web browsers, because scripts can be used to create the chosen plaintext. On the other hand, many installed servers on the public Internet, and most popular browsers, don't support any version later than 1.0. Most, but not all, do support at least 1.0.If your product includes an HTTPS server, you will probably have to enable versions at least  as far back as 1.0 by default.

This was causing snort to hit 100% cpu, and on ftd this causes lots of drops.There is a feature in ASA to mitigate this type of issue - TCP intercept. We need the ability to turn this on in 6.1.0.x, since we need a way to prevent an FTD device from being severely compromised by this.Turning it on via CLISH is not an option, since it is turned off by policy apply. So perhaps a way to fix this is to allow policy apply to not change it if it's on. Or better would be to have an option in the UI to configure it.

The vulnerability scanner is Retina from eEye. www.eeye.com/RetinaThere are several indications that memory usage is a factor in the crash and wecan see that the ASA dhcp code forces the crash after an assert failure, whichwas most likely (?) induced by a malloc failure.The customer has twin ASA's in a failover pair, one with 256MB, one with1024MB. Only the former crashes when subjected to this scan. 256MB should besufficient for the version that the customer is running however.OTOH, I also see several empty BOOTP packets in the captures i.e. destinationudp port 67 but udp length 8 i.e. zero UDP payload bytes.Perhaps these are not well handled by the ASA dhcp server but that would notexplain why the 1024MB survives the scan whereas the 256MB box does not."," PSIRT-owner: psirt@cisco.com           This issue has been evaluated and driven to closure by PSIRT.

I found, that the memory management of the VPNClient is semioptimal to hide the cleartext preshared keysfrom the eyes of my students. Attached is a small perl scriptwhich clearly shows that the encrypted GroupPwd's (thepreshared keys!) are very easy breakable with the ltrace(1)library tracer. With the knowledge of this PSK it is againvery easy to build an IKE fake Daemon (300 lines in perl) tosteal the login credentials in a MiTM manner. This is reality,believe me! With tools like ettercap or cain&abel even scriptkiddies are able to play MiTM in a wireless environment.First I build a Captive Gateway with SSL encryption, butsome of my students played very fast MiTM. Most of my othercustomers ignored the SSL warning. Therefore I proofed theCisco VPN Solution for applibaleness to secure my WLANenvironment, but this is even worse since here we get evenno warning.

A device may be affected by one vulnerability and not affected by another.  This advisory is posted at http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20100811-ace.shtml. ","The SSL stack for the ACE module runs on each of the IXPs.  It uses a Cavium Nitrox-II processor to offload a number of cryptographic operations.  The stack communicates to the Nitrox-II by assembling requests in the form of packets that are sent over SPI to the Nitrox-II via the CDE.  For each of these requests, the Nitrox-II generates a response packet which is sent back to the corresponding IXP via SPI.The Nitrox-II is a highly integrated processor.  In addition to hardware for performing packet processing and cryptographic acceleration, it contains multiple CPUs and has its own DRAM.  As such, there is the possibility that it can crash when trying to process requests from the SSL stack.If the Nitrox-II crashes, we need to the ability to gather information about the crash.

CSC.sys,c7600,c7600-acl,customer-use,3,0,0,CSCsv43084,ipv6 routing header acl doesn't work properly on c7600," Symptom: On a Cisco 7600 with Sup720, an IPv6 access-list configured to block extension headers will only  work in the software path due to hardware limitation.  However, since this processing is only  done in the software path, the IPv6 traffic may cause high CPU.  More specifically, if an ACL is configured to drop extension headers, such as the following ACL:  ipv6 access-list DENY-IPV6-RH  deny ipv6 any any routing  permit ipv6 any any  The IPv6 traffic with the routing header set will still be passed since this ACL is programmed in  hardware. If the following command is enabled, it will force all ACL checks to be punted to the  control point:  no mls rate-limit unicast acl input  Once the above command is enabled, any IPv6 traffic with the routing header set will be dropped,  as per the configured ACL. The result of enabling the above command is the potential for high  CPU, depending on the amount of traffic that is checked against the ACL.  Conditions: This issue only occurs if the 7600 is configured with IPv6 ACLs to filter extension headers.  There are two possible results with an ACL is configured to filter extension headers:  1. Turn off the rate limiting function for traffic that is sent to the control point due to ACL look up: no mls rate-limit unicast acl input  This will send all traffic matching the ACL to the control point for software processing. The IPv6  traffic with extension headers will not be properly filtered. Be aware that all traffic matching the  ACL will be sent to the control point so this poses a risk of high CPU.  2. Turn on the rate limiting function for traffic that is sent to the control point due to ACL look up.  This is the default setting:  mls rate-limit unicast acl input  This will cause all the traffic to be checked against the ACL in hardware. The extension headers  will not be filtered, but the control point will not experience high CPU.  Please note: this has potential to rate-limit the traffic being punted to control point due to  ACL based features that require punting too. Eg. NAT, WCCP, SLB etc.  Workaround: None. This is expected behaviour of the 7600 platform. The current hardware architecture of the  7600 does not support processing of IPv6 extension headers in hardware. As a result, if IPv6  extension header filtering is required, that traffic must be punted to the control point for software  processing.  IPv6 HbH can be rate-limited on NPU based linecards like Sip400 and ES  via ""test platform  police ipv6 set...""

The vulnerability is due to lack of protecting confidential information at rest in response to SNMP poll requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by doing a crafted SNMP poll request to the targeted security appliance. An exploit could allow the attacker to discover confidential information which should be restricted and the attacker could use this information to conduct additional reconnaissance attacks. The attacker would have knowledge of the configured SNMP  community string to exploit this vulnerability.  Conditions: The security appliance is configured for SNMP polling.  Workaround: A mitigation for this vulnerability is to disable SNMP. If SNMP is not enabled the device is not vulnerable.  Further Problem Description: None.

CSC.sys,all,accsw-identity,customer-use,6,0,0,CSCut25671,802.1x ENH untagged voice packets should not be allowed within data vlan," Symptoms:  This is a design problem related to 802.1x with switches. A switchport can be configured with MAB or 802.1x. We need to have voice VLAN. Once voice device authenticates it might not know yet the voice VLAN but  it can learn the voice VLAN via cdp, lddp or dhcp. That can take time (for cdp by default switch sends packets every 60s) and because of that the phone can send untagged frames. It will happen always  when phone is not supporting cdp or lldp and using dhcp for voice VLAN discovery. As a result IOS needs to accept untagged frames (data vlan) from voice device (which is already marked in voice domain because of device-traffic-class = voice returned in Access-Accept). IOS will accept untagged frames from voice device till it receives first tagged frame and then it will not accept untagged frames from that device any longer.  Conditions:  Normal Operations.  Workaround:  We should push DACL for the phone devices. That DACL should limit the traffic to within voice vlan.

DACL creates additional constraints - some customers would like to have full access (also to data vlan) from phones.The proposal is the following:When authenticating voice device we should dynamically create ACL: auth-default-ACL (as we do it now to protect the phase between authentication and authorization). That ACL should be applied for that voice device. It should allow only for DHCP traffic.Once voice device starts tagging frames it should be removed.

CSC.sys,cat6000,cat6000-fabric,customer-use,1,0,0,CSCsc55949,C2 Frequent fabric channel sync errors and rxErrors," Problem description:  Supervisor 720-based Catalyst 6500 and Cisco 7600 systems running Cisco IOS equipped with PFC3A/3B/3BXL based supervisor module and CEF720 series modules (67xx) with or without DFC3A/3B/3BXL may encounter a rare out-of-synchronization condition on the fabric-channel between a particular module and the switch fabric on the supervisor engine in certain circumstances. These conditions can lead to affected module power cycle, permanent power down or supervisor switchover in dual supervisor configurations and cause partial network outage.  Most of the out-of-synchronization condition are caused by false classification of fabric-channel events by switch fabric firmware triggering excessive fabric-channel resynchronization. Excessive resynchronization events may also contribute to increasing rxErrors reported by receiving fabric-enabled module.  Symptoms:  Sep 18 20:42:31 GMT: SP:  Linecard endpoint of Channel 14 lost Sync. to Lower fabric and trying to recover now!  Oct 19 22:55:00.986 GMT: %C6KPWR-SP-4-DISABLED: power to module in slot 8 set off (Fabric channel errors)  Problem resolution:  Fabric-channel out-of-synchronization issue has been resolved by new fabric firmware desing with enhanced fabric-channel condition classification and improved timing aspects across all fabric related asics which should prevent excessive fabric-channel resynchronization and lessen rxErrors occurrence.  Recommended action:  The recommended action is to upgrade to Cisco IOS software release 12.2(18)SXE5 or 12.2(18)SXF3 or later to take advantage of the redesigned fabric-channel monitoring mechanism. When running Cisco IOS versions prior to those mentioned above, it is recommended to use below engineering cli to minimize the risk of running into this problem.  sup720#remote command switch test fabric flap count 10 sup720#remote command switch test fabric flap time 1   ",Customer is experiencing frequent fabric channel 14 sync errors with 6704 in slot 6 resulting in line card power cycling which has a great impact to the overall network.

The vulnerability occurs because AAA processes prevent the NX-OS System Manager from receiving keepalive messages when an affected device receives a high rate of login attempts, such as in a brute-force login attack. System memory can run low on the FXOS devices under the same conditions, which could cause the AAA process to unexpectedly restart or cause the device to reload.  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing a brute-force login attack against a device that is configured with AAA security services. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

Conditions: The issue had been observed in pure IPv4 chassis with VRF/MPLS-VPN configuration. The issue had  also been observed in IPv6 enabled chassis.  In both situation, a CPE moving from one modem to  another modem is the critical part to trigger the issue.   The issue has been reproduced by moving a dual-stack CPE between two different modems,  deliberately changing the CPE provisioning mode, and performing two PRE switchovers.  There may be  other corner case scenarios that can cause the condition.  Workaround: For CMTS where IPv6 is enabled on bundle interface, which doesn't have VRF/MPLS-VPN configuration:  1) Avoid moving IPv6 CPEs between modems.  Configure DOCSIS Packet Filters or LLC Filters to drop  IPv6 ND messages to prevent unauthorized CPE from obtaining IPv6 Link Local Addresses.     2) If an IPv6 CPE is going to be moved to a different modem, before plugging the CPE into the new  modem, use the following CLIs to cleanup the CPE from the CMTS subscriber DB:   Clear cable host cpe-mac-addr   Clear cable modem cm-mac-addr delete  For CMTS with VRF/MPLS-VPN configuration: Prevent CPE move from one modem to another modem.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious HTTP request to the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to overflow a buffer, resulting in a crash of the iUSRM/i process or the execution of arbitrary code. In the event of a crash, the iUSRM/i process will be restarted automatically by a watchdog.  Conditions: Running Recorder Manager software prior to version 4.0.0-793.  Workaround: There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Further Problem Description: The vulnerability described in this document is due to a buffer overflow in a logging function. This logging function is supposed to print a URL. It fails to properly validate the length of the URL it receives before copying it into an internal buffer. When the received string is larger than the memory space that has been allocated for the target buffer the crash is observed or the supplied code could be executed.  In 4.0.0-793 and later software releases mechanisms to properly validate the length of the received string have been added.

CSC.voice,epas,security,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCue94950,Cisco Jabber fails to validate cup-xmpp security certificate," Symptom: An instance of Cisco Jabber 9.2 running in a Single Sign On mode performs validation of the cup-xmpp certificate. The default cup-xmpp certificate fails this validation. The impact is that on Jabber the user always gets a security warning about the cup-xmpp certificate at log-in time.  Conditions:  Cisco Jabber requires that the presence domain be defined in the cup-xmpp certificate in order to validate the cup-xmpp certificate correctly. It is possible to place the presence domain in the cup-xmpp certificate using the Cisco Unified Presence Administration GUI.   1. Navigate to Cisco Unified Presence Administration  System  Security  XMPP Certificate Settings  2. Enter the presence domain value in the ""Domain name for XMPP Server-to-Server Certificate Subject Common name"" text-box  3. Check the ""Use Domain Name for XMPP Certificate Subject Common Name"" check-box  3. Click Save  4. Acknowledge the warning and complete the advised steps.  This procedure places the presence domain value in the Subject Common Name field of the certificate. However, some customers may not be comfortable issuing a certificate with a presence domain (i.e. cisco.com) in the Subject Common Name of the Certificate Authority (CA) signed certificate.  Workaround:  If a customer is satisfied to issue a CA signed certificate with the presence domain in the Subject Common Name of the certificate, it is valid means to overcome this issue.  If a customer is NOT satisfied to issue a CA signed certificate with the presence domain in the Subject Common Name of the certificate, no workaround is available. End Users must continue to accept the security warning for the cup-xmpp certificate at each log-in of Cisco Jabber.","Cisco Jabber 9.2 running in an SSO mode performs validation of the cup-xmpp certificate. The default cup-xmpp certificate fails this validation. The impact is that on Jabber, the user always gets a security warning at login.Jabber requires that the presence domain be defined somewhere in the cup-xmpp certificate in order to validate the cup-xmpp certificate correctly.CUP provides a way to put the presence domain into the cup-xmpp & cup-xmpp-s2s certificates, in the Subject CN field, to facilitate XMPP federation. This same mechanism could be used to facilitate the Jabber requirement. However, feedback from EFT and GGSG teams is that customers will not sign a certificate with presence domain in the Subject CN field of the certificate.The reasoning is that any host under that domain can use such a certificate and that certificate is not tied to one particular host/server.The solution is to modify the CUP Admin > System > Security controls to place a custom value in the Subject Alt Name of the cup-xmpp & cup-xmpp-s2s certs as opposed to the Subject Common Name.This is not an issue for IM&P 10.0 as the logic is already in place, see http://ccollab.cisco.com:8080/ui#review:id=95702"," PSIRT-owner: psirt@cisco.com           This issue has been evaluated and driven to closure by PSIRT.

CSC.embu,wlc,wlc-dot1x-wpa,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCvc71674,Cisco Wireless LAN Controller SNMP Memory Leak Denial of Service Vulnerability," Symptom: A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subsystem of Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to restart, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerability is due to a memory leak that occurs on an affected device after the device fails to deallocate a buffer that is used when certain MIBs are polled. An attacker who knows the SNMP Version 2 SNMP Read string or has valid SNMP Version 3 credentials for an affected device could repeatedly poll the affected MIB object IDs (OIDs) and consume available memory on the device. When memory is sufficiently depleted on the device, the device will restart, resulting in a DoS condition.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link: https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171101-wlc1  Conditions: Cisco Wireless LAN Controller devices running an affected version of software are affected.

No crash log is produced.Steps to reproduce:Perform SNMP Bulk Get against the following MIB tables. Periodically execute ???show memory pool??? to track 16-byte buffer size for SNMPTask over time. 16-byte buffer pool keeps increasing monotonically. We were able to crash the controller in a few hours by polling these tables continuously.In our lab environment (2 clients and 3 access points), we observe the following rate of leak. We didn???t test to see if the rate of leak increases as the number of devices or APs increase.1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.9998.1.1.3.2 (clExtApDot11IfTable) - leaks 36 16-byte buffers per SNMP Bulk Get1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.599.1.4.1 (cldcClientStatisticTable) - leaks 2 16-byte buffers  per SNMP Bulk Get1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.599.1.3.1 (cldcClientTable) - leaks 2 16-byte buffers per SNMP Bulk GetHere is a sample ???show memory pool??? output at 2 different times while performing bulk SNMP Get continuously against 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.9998.1.1.3.2.

CSC.sys,all,ip,customer-use,1,0,0,CSCea02355,rare ip packets may cause input queue wedge," Cisco routers and switches running Cisco IOS software and configured to process Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) packets are vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. A rare sequence of crafted IPv4 packets sent directly to the device may cause the input interface to stop processing traffic once the input queue is full. No authentication is required to process the inbound packet. Processing of IPv4 packets is enabled by default. Devices running only IP version 6 (IPv6) are not affected. A workaround is available.

CSC.sys,all,hsrp,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCec26539,HSRP: Software crash forced when doing HSRP SNMP query, Symptoms: A Cisco router that has a Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) group  configured on a subinterface may stop responding and may reload.  Conditions: This symptom is observed when an HSRP Simple Network Management  Protocol (SNMP) query is performed. The symptom occurs only when HSRP is  configured on a subinterface. The symptom does not occur for an HSRP  group that is configured on a major interface.  Workaround: Do not initiate an SNMP query for HSRP.  Alternate Workaround: Use the snmp-serverno global  configuration command to specify which MIBs are available (for example):  snmp-server view HSRP internet included snmp-server view HSRP ciscoHsrpMIB excluded snmp-server view HSRP ciscoHsrpExtMIB excluded snmp-server community public view HSRP RW 20 snmp-server community private view HSRP RW 20no  ,"a cisco 7206VXR (NPE400) running IOS (tm) 7200 Software (C7200-JK9O3S-M), Version 12.3(2.1), crashes when querying the Cisco group hsrp table.The customer provided the crashinfofile when the following debugging was enabled :ro110wa1#sho debugging SNMP:  SNMP packet debugging is onSNMP:  SNMP MGR requests debugging is onro110wa1#  -Does this crash also occur when no debugging is enabled ?#yes  -Does it always crash every time when querying the Cisco group hsrp table, or only on rare occasions ?#yes, every time when querying Cisco hrsp group table  -

CSC.datacenter,ucs-rack-server,web-mgmt,customer-use,3,0,0,CSCue77861,CIMC web interface vulnerable to clickjacking," Symptoms:  A vulnerability in the web interface of the Cisco Integrated Management Controller (CIMC) of the Cisco UCS C-Series Rack Servers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute a cross-frame scripting (XFS) attack. The vulnerability is due to insufficient HTML iframe protection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by directing a user to an attacker-controlled web page that contains a malicious HTML iframe. An exploit could allow the attacker to conduct clickjacking or other client-side browser attacks.   Conditions:  Device configured with default configuration running an affected version of the Cisco Integrated Management Controller software.   Workaround:  None.   Further Problem Description:  This defect was resolved via bug ID CSCuf50138.  Symptom: A vulnerability in the web interface of the Cisco Integrated Management Controller (CIMC) of the Cisco UCS C-Series Rack Servers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute a cross-frame scripting (XFS) attack. The vulnerability is due to insufficient HTML iframe protection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by directing a user to an attacker-controlled web page that contains a malicious HTML iframe. An exploit could allow the attacker to conduct clickjacking or other client-side browser attacks.  Conditions: Device configured with default configuration running an affected version of the Cisco Integrated Management Controller software.  Workaround: None.  Further Problem Description: This defect was resolved via bug ID CSCuf50138.  Symptom:  Conditions:  Workaround:  Further Problem Description:  ","The CIMC web interface is susceptible to clickjacking, a UI redressing attack.  If a user has been successfully authenticated by the CIMC Software web interface and the user browses to other web sites without logging out of the web interface, then a malicious web site can hijack a user's session by framing the CIMC web interface with an iframe.  This iframe can then be hidden by altering the frame's opacity.  Once hidden, the malicious site can overlay UI elements over the framed CIMC UI elements in order to elicit a click from the unsuspecting user.  This click can then be passed through to the CIMC interface which could cause a change in the configuration.  To defend against this vulnerability, two mitigations must be implemented.  First, the CIMC web server must add the X-Frame-Options header to all HTTP responses.  The value for this header should either be DENY, if all web pages are forbidden toframe the requested page, or SAMEORIGIN, if the CIMC web interface requires the requested page to be framed by other pages within the CIMC web interface.  This HTTP header is non-standard, but it is honored by IE = 8.0, Firefox = 3.6.9, Opera = 10.50, Safari = 4.0, and Chrome = 4.1.249.1024.  For more information on an upcoming standard which may replace X-Frame-Options, please refer to: http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-gondrom-frame-options-01.txt.Second, in order to protect users running web browsers which do not honor the X-Frame-Options header,  JavaScript frame busting code should be added to all web pages.  This JavaScript code should determine if a page is being framed and prevent the framing from occurring.  For guidance on frame busting code, please refer to OWASP: http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking , a Stanford frame busting study: http://seclab.stanford.edu/websec/framebusting/framebust.pdf , and an example defense: https://www.codemagi.com/blog/post/194 . The combination of the X-Frame-Options header and frame busting JavaScript code should protect a significant portion of the user base."," PSIRT-owner: jacline           PSIRT is reviewing this issue for possible inclusion in a Cisco Security  Advisory which could include this DDTs.

CSC.workgrp,cat6000,telnet,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCef42764,Cat6k may crash with PID = 146 ssh147 when connecting via ssh,"  Symptoms:-  A Catalyst 6K running the K9 software image may crash when an SSH client tries  to connect.   Conditions:- The switch might crash while establishing SSH connection to client using SSH version-2. The crash may be seen only if SSH version-2 is enabled on Catalyst 6K and SSH client tries to connect to Catalyst 6K using SSH version-2. But the chances are very low.   Workaround: The workaround is to disable SSHv2 and use SSH version-1 by setting ssh mode to V1. Or if the customer can switch to Telnet instead of SSH, then clearing the crypto key using ""clear crypto key rsa "" will prevent this crash.  The fix will be available in 8.3(4) release. As an alternative use telnet or SSHv1.

CSC.sys,all,ipsec-isakmp,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCed94829,IOS reloads due to malformed IKE messages," Multiple Cisco products contain vulnerabilities in the processing of IPSec IKE (Internet Key Exchange) messages. These vulnerabilities were identified by the University of Oulu Secure Programming Group (OUSPG)  ;PROTOS ; Test Suite for IPSec and can be repeatedly exploited to produce a denial of service.  Cisco has made free software available to address this vulnerability for affected customers. Prior to deploying software, customers should consult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature set compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.  This advisory is posted at http://www.cisco.com/warp/customer/707/cisco-sa-20051114-ipsec.shtml",See Attachment: Description.txt," PSIRT-owner: psirt@cisco.com           This issue has been evaluated and driven to closure by PSIRT.  PSIRT has provided a public Release-note Enclosure (RNE) for this issue which is visible on Cisco.com.   If a customer is being impacted by this issue, please guide them to the 'Workaround' section of the RNE or recommend a software upgrade to a patched release.   If a patched release is not available  for the customer-specific situation, you will need to escalate the issue  through the DE manager or the business unit that owns the DDTs defect.  There is no need to contact PSIRT for this issue.  Do not provide customers with any information beyond what is currently contained in the RNE."
CSC.sys,all,bgp,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCee67450,BGP error msg trackback," A Cisco device running IOS and enabled for the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack from a malformed BGP packet. Only devices with the command bgp log-neighbor-changes configured are vulnerable. The BGP protocol is not enabled by default, and must be configured in order to accept traffic from an explicitly defined peer. Unless the malicious traffic appears to be sourced from a configured, trusted peer, it would be difficult to inject a malformed packet.  Cisco has made free software available to address this problem.  This issue is tracked by CERT/CC VU#689326.
