The failure signature will continue on software reset and the Supervisor will fail POST.  However, once power is completely  removed, the supervisor will continue to work as normal.Failures that continue after power is removed are not part of this DDTS.  Hard failures with SRAM are a normal occurance within the expected failure rate of the product.It is unknown is this issue is a software or hardware defect at this time.  Please the TAC-NOTE for additional troubleshooting. "," Symptoms:  Devices connected to a Catalyst 4000 with a WS-X4013 Supervisor II Engine may experience partial or full loss of network connectivity. The loss of connectivity may affect only a portion of the switch ports and may include the uplink ports. These symptoms will be accompanied by rapidly increasing Invalid CRC packets within the switch.  The problem is due to an SRAM component failure which is transient in nature. Please refer to the description of the bug CSCec78085. This SRAM failure has also been seen on Supervisor Engines III (WS-X4014) and IV (WS-X4515). Please see CSCdz57255 for details.  The following indications will be present:  Note: The switch must be running CatOS versions 5.5(10) or higher OR 6.2(3) or higher. Proper identification of this bug is not possible prior to these software versions due to CSCdt80707 or CSCdu48749.  1. At default logging levels, the logging buffer will show a number of the    following messages:  %SYS-4-P2_WARN: 1/Invalid crc, dropped packet, count = xxxx  2. Successive iterations of the command show env 1no for CatOS Releases 5.5(19) and below or show nvramenv 1no for CatOS Releases 6.1(1) and above will show the counter for InvalidPacketBufferCrcs steadily increasing. The increase over several minutes will be in the range of hundreds or thousands. If a small number of InvalidPacketBufferCrcs are seen and the number is not increasing, then that is not an indication of a problem.  The following information should be captured:  show logging buffer -1023no show env 1no or show nvramenv 1no (several iterations) show sprom 1no dump 1no show health 1no show techno  3. After a soft reset of the switch by issuing the resetno command, the Supervisor will fail POST. The POST results should be captured to a text file.  Note: Under certain circumstances POST may abort abruptly, and log the following message:  Insufficient memory pages to satisfy allocation request   Out of memory!  In this situation, the POST results will not be correctly reflected in the  ""sh test 1"" O/P.  This behavior should not be seen on switches running CatOS version 8.2(1)GLX or greater.  4. If the switch is running an image 6.4(7) or 7.6(5) or 8.3(1)GLX or higher capture the following commands: show test switch-memory detailno show test switch-memory affected-entriesno  5. After a hard reset (power off/on) of the switch the Supervisor will pass POST and there will be no further symptoms of the problem. The POST results should be captured to a text file.  All indications must be present in order to conclude that the problem was due to this bug.   Conditions:  This problem has been traced to an SRAM component failure which is transient in nature. The incidence of this failure is extremely rare and is well below the predicted failure rates for this component.  If you believe that you have encountered this bug please open a case with the TAC (Technical Assistance Center) and attach the above captured output to the  TAC case. Boards exhibiting this failure should be replaced using RMA.   Workaround:  Hard reset the switch by powering it off and on.   Software Enhancement:  Newer versions of CatOS software for the Catalyst 4000 family switches now run ongoing diagnostics to detect an SRAM failure. We recommend to use 6.4(8), 7.6(5), 8.3(1)GLX or later released images to use this enhancement.  For further details, please refer to the release-note for the bug CSCec78085.  "

CSC.sys-wish,all,ssh,customer-use,3,0,0,0,CSCeg62710,Need a separate command to enable/disable SSH,"Currently SSH is automatically enabled when the RSA keys are generated.Customers have been confused by the requirement to generate RSA key to start up SSH.In customers' mind, these two are not connected.Another problem is SSL also requires the RSA keypair to be generated.So there is no way to enable SSL without enabling SSH even though theseare two separate features. So it is impossible to disable SSH on platforms where SSL is enabled by default (e.g. Cat3550 and Cat3750 switches).We should provide a CLI command to enable/disable SSH instead of relying onthe presence of the host RSA keys to determine whether SSH should be enabled. In addition, SSH should have the ability to generate its own keys if none exists.Perhaps there is a way to integrate the current and the new behavior so that by default it works like it works now. Then add a ;no ip ssh enable; to allow customers to generate a keypair without SSH being enabled.And ;ip ssh enable; would do both - generate a SSH specific keypair (even if another keypair exists) and enable SSH."," Symptom:  The SSH server in Cisco IOS may become enabled without explicit configuration to have it enabled.  Conditions:  This may happen when IOS automatically generates an RSA keypair to be used by another function, like the HTTPS server.  Workarounds:  In some versions of IOS it is possible to prevent IOS from enabling the SSH server when the default RSA keypair is generated by configuring the SSH server to use a specific, named RSA keypair. For example:  router(config)#ip ssh rsa keypair-name SSHKEY  Please create RSA keys to enable SSH. router(config)#crypto key generate rsa label SSHKEY modulus 1024 The name for the keys will be: SSHKEY  % The key modulus size is 1024 bits % Generating 1024 bit RSA keys, keys will be non-exportable...[OK]  router(config)# *Jan  9 11:30:28.119: %SSH-5-ENABLED: SSH 1.99 has been enabled  Further Information:  This bug is an enhancement request to have an explicit configuration knob to enable the SSH server in IOS. This way the SSH server won't end up running when RSA keys are automatically generated, like described above.

One is SNMP should not allow usersto modify those default vlan names. I see cat4k already checkin somefix for this via CSCef42883 to cosmos_e. Wen, you might want to patchit to pikespeak.The other problem is VTP code failing to restore the database properlywhen there's error occured. I'll look into this.Thanks,- weng"," If there's any failure during VTP VLANs configuration, VTP code would fail to restore the backedup VTP database correctly and cause a 0-VLAN VTP  runtime database to be restored. If users reload the system at this point, the VTP database can still be recovered based on the NVRAM VTP storage file. However, if users further modified any VTP domain configuration, e.g. VTP mode, VTP domain name etc. the 0-VLAN VTP runtime database content would be written  to NVRAM. After this point, even though users reload the system, the original VTP VLAN database will be wiped out and the system will come up with the factory default VTP VLAN database, i.e. VTP in server mode with no domain name configured and only VLANs 1,1002-1005 are configured.

NOT seen in IP only image for 2500 12.0(4)T c2500-i-l image.Hidden ILMI community string also seen in earlier code when ATM present ANDsnmp is enabled (at least one community string in config) - seen in 11.2(15a)c7000-js-m code. Note that in this case, behaviour only seen AFTER a communitystring is added to config."," Cisco IOS software releases based on versions 11.x and 12.0 contain    a defect that allows a limited number of SNMP objects to be viewed    and modified without authorization using a undocumented ILMI    community string. Some of the modifiable objects are confined to the    MIB-II system group, such as  ;sysContact ;,  ;sysLocation ;, and     ;sysName ;, that do not affect the device&apos;s normal operation but that    may cause confusion if modified unexpectedly. The remaining objects    are contained in the LAN-EMULATION-CLIENT and PNNI MIBs, and    modification of those objects may affect ATM configuration. An    affected device might be vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack if    it is not protected against unauthorized use of the ILMI community    string.        The vulnerability is only present in certain combinations of IOS    releases on Cisco routers and switches. ILMI is a necessary    component for ATM, and the vulnerability is present in every IOS    release that contains the supporting software for ATM and ILMI    without regard to the actual presence of an ATM interface or the    physical ability of the device to support an ATM connection.        To remove this vulnerability, Cisco is offering free software    upgrades for all affected platforms. The defect is documented in    DDTS record CSCdp11863.        In lieu of a software upgrade, a workaround can be applied to    certain IOS releases by disabling the ILMI community or  ;*ilmi ; view    and applying an access list to prevent unauthorized access to SNMP.    Any affected system, regardless of software release, may be    protected by filtering SNMP traffic at a network perimeter or on    individual devices.

CSC.sys-wish,all,tcp,customer-use,3,0,0,0,CSCeg15587,ECN and MD5 compatibility issues.,"This bug was discovered while investigating CSCeg13149. After the ECN supportwas added (CSCeb11974) to IOS, this bug was introduced. ECN bits (CWR, ECE)needs to be written before the MD5 option/digest gets computed. This is obvious since the MD5 digest includes the TCP header and the ECN  bits are part of the TCP header.The curent code writes the ECN bits after the MD5 option is written. This is problematic in situations where MD5 and ECN is turned on, the other side would reject the packet since its digest wouldn't match the one in the packet.The solution is to move the ECN bits writing ahead of MD5 write. PS: the bug is not planned to be fixed in any M/T train (but IOS XE only).", Symptom: When ECN is turned on (ip tcp ecn) and MD5 option is also configured the TCP connection may not come up. You will see the BADAUTH messages popping up in one of the ends of the TCP connection.  PFRv3 won't form TCP connection in this case. BGP may form TCP (having just a single SYN packet logged).  Conditions: When both ECN and MD5 is turned on for a TCP connection.  Workaround: 1. Disable ECN. ( no ip tcp ecn). MD5 can be disabled if the application  ( like BGP) chooses to for the TCP connection  2. or decrease ip tcp synwait-time 5 ( from default 30). PFRv3 session will be established.

However, Cisco pre-standard power devices will be powered (PoE)  when ""max milli-watts"" is configured as such. And if many high-power  Cisco pre-standard power devices (AP-1200s) are attached when the ports  are configured with a low max value (lower than the actual consumption),  there is a chance of oversubscribing the power supply on a 48 port PoE switch.   Condition: IEEE classification gives the switch the ability to know the maximum  power consumption of a PD before it is powered on. The switch will only  grant power when the ""max milli-watts"" is greater than or equal to the  IEEE class max, to ensure the power budget is not oversubscribed. There is  no such mechanism in Cisco pre-standard power devices.   Workaround: For networks containing AP1200, or other pre-standard high powered PDs,  use a max of at least 11.6W (11600mw).  For networks containing IEEE Class 0, 3, or 4 devices, do not configure  max below 15.4W (15400mw). "

In the current code, there is an assumption that only 1 buffer descriptor is required for each packet. In fact, different combination of crypto features will lead to different requirements as listed below: encry/decry                             1 BDsingle AUTH                            	3 BDsdouble AUTH                           	6 BDsencry/decry + single AUTH       	3 BDsencry/decry + double AUTH      		6 BDs  2)  In our FPGA-crypto design, there is a total 256 buffer-descriptor available.When running ;encry/decry + double AUTH;, a total of 6 BDs is required for each packet. Considering bi-directional traffic as follows:Tx direction (encryption+authentication):{FE0/0: 64 Rx-ring entries} ------> {FPGA-crypto: 256 BDs} -----> {FE0/1: 128 tx-ring entries} ----> {to peer}Rx direction (decryption+authentication):{FE0/1 (GRE-tunnels): 64 Rx-ring entries} ------> {FPGA-crypto: 256 BDs}If we are under extremely high traffic in both the RX and TX direction; theoretically, we might encounter the shortage of FPGA-crypto BDs since 2x64x6 = 768 entries are required. I have already checked with Jim Grishaw and found that the FPGA-buffer descriptor cannot be further increased beacuse of HW limitation. Therefore, we have no choice and need to drop the packets if FPGA-buffer descriptor is full. Another alternative is to enable Crypto LLQ as suggested by Tracy. But, this solution might further degrade the Crypto throughput performance. "," Symptom: Error Messages of insufficent buffer-descriptors in FPGA-crypto engine happens when running high traffic in IPSec/VPN application.  Conditions: Running ""ESP-3DES + ESP-SHA1 + GRE"" applications under very high  traffic might trigger this problems  Workaround: Reloading the router resolves the issue temporarily.

Unicast traffic entering through the egress source port, and the packet is      flooded across the VLAN  2. Broadcast/multicast traffic entering through the egress source port   Workaround: There is no workaround for this problem.  Further Problem Description: The reason for this behaviour is that, internally the received packet (for eg OSPF hello) on a port has to be flooded on all ports on the vlan and the port which received the packet is also a port in that vlan.  SPAN captures this as a trasmitted packet and display it, eventhough, the packet it internally dropped at the ASIC.  This is a well known limitation of SPAN feature in CatOS (Hybrid) systems also and is documented using ddts CSCds22021. "

CSC.sys,cat4000,cat4000-hw,customer-use,2,0,0,0,CSCed61591,Packets above certain size may get dropped by Catalyst 4000,"Due to cosmic radiations, a particular revision of an SRAM from a certain vendorcan experience a single block failure. This failure has been seen in 4 megabitand 8 megabit parts which are used on all of the Catalyst 4000 family switches.These failures are transient in nature and are cleared on a power cycle.Failing bit locations on SRAMs in the failed mode were analyzed and compared tothe internal structure of the sram. All data pointed to cosmic ray radiationcausing the failure, which are known to impact semiconductor devices indifferent ways. Similar effect can be achieved by using ionizing radiations. Thevendor has reproduced theblock failure on a switch in a hospital cancer treatment lab by using acontrolled radiations. After each test the SRAM exhibited a single block failureand recovered on a power cycle, leading the vendor to this conclusion about theroot cause.An SRAM is divided into quadrants and each quadrant is further divided intoblocks. When sub-atomic particles (cosmic rays or ionizing radiations) strike abit in the SRAM in a particular way, the bit  becomes stuck at 1 or 0 and storesexcessive charge. The failure spreads to other bits within the block as a resultof the excessive charge.These particular SRAMs make up the packet buffer memory of the switch, the placewhere a packet is stored when it passes through the switch. The architecture ofthe Catalyst 4000 supervisors is such that each packet written to packet memoryis spread across all of the SRAMs in the system. This increases the probabilityof using the failed part of an SRAM and most packets get corrupted. Thesepackets may leave the switch with a CRC error resulting in packets getting discarded by the link partner.The symptoms of this problem are:- Data loss through the switch- CRC errors on link partnersThe problem has been seen on SUP III & SUP IV IOS based catalyst 4000 products.","  If you see this problem on your switch, the Supervisor should be  replaced. A packet memory diagnostic feature has been enabled to  detect this problem and log appropriate messages.  Software Detection and Workaround  --------------------------------- Newer versions of software for the Catalyst 4000 family switches now run ongoing diagnostics to detect an SRAM failure. The new ongoing diagnostics run read/write tests on packet memory to detect stuck bits. By default, once a memory failure has been detected by the ongoing tests, the system is reset. On boot-up, the affected packet buffers are removed from circulation and hardware switching continues with the unaffected packet buffers. When in such ""normal"" mode, a syslog message is generated every thirty minutes so that the problem gets due attention. As switching continues in ""normal"" mode, it allows you time to schedule downtime for the network and replace the supervisor at a convenient time.  While the system is running, packet buffers cannot be removed from circulation.  Hence, when an SRAM failure is detected, the system is reset so that boot-up tests find the bad block and remove all affected packet buffers from circulation in hardware.  In some network configurations, redundancy is provided by using a redundant link or system and HSRP or similar protocols. In such configurations, a switch with a failed SRAM would need to stay down instead of working in ""normal"" mode, so that network redundancy can be used to switch traffic through an alternate path.  A configuration option ""aggressive"" has been provided to achieve this. With the ""aggressive"" option, the system is reset when an SRAM failure is detected and all ports stay down.  A supervisor that has had an occurence of the SRAM failure should be returned to Cisco. The replacement supervisors do not use this particular version of the SRAM.    CLI ----  	Configuration:         --------------  To direct the action of the switch when it detects a packet memory failure,  use the ""diagnostic monitor action"" command.  Syntax Description:  diagnostic monitor action [conservative | normal | aggressive]  conservative (Optional): The bootup SRAM diagnostics log all failures and remove all affected buffers from the hardware operation. The ongoing SRAM diagnostics will log events, but will take no other action.  normal (Optional): The SRAM diagnostics operate as in conservative mode, except that an ongoing failure resets the supervisor engine. This action allows for the bootup tests to map out the affected memory.  aggressive (Optional) The SRAM diagnostics operate as in normal mode, except that a bootup failure only logs failures and does not allow the supervisor engine to come online. This action allows for either a redundant supervisor engine or network-level redundancy to take over.  Default: normal  Command Mode: Global configuration mode   Usage Guidelines  The ""conservative"" keyword is useful when you do not want the switch to reboot in order to fix the problem. The ""aggressive"" keyword is useful when using redundant supervisor engines, or  when network-level redundancy has been provided.  Examples   This example shows how to configure the switch to initiate an RPR switchover  when an ongoing failure occurs:  Switch# configure terminal Switch (config)# diagnostic monitor action normal  Logged Messages :  When Transient SRAM failure is detected by the software, following message is initially logged :   ""%C4K_SWITCHINGENGINEMAN-2-PACKETMEMORYERROR3: Persistent Errors  in Packet Memory number ""  and later,  ""%C4K_SWITCHINGENGINEMAN-3-PACKETMEMORYERROR2: Multiple Errors in  Packet Memory number ""  In later versions, where the switch is configured in ""normal"" mode to reboot  on detecting such failure, following message is logged after reboot  completes :  ""Packet Memory buffer test detected errors with   of the packet buffers.   Switch operation will continue, with potentially reduced performance.""  In case the switch reboots (in normal mode) with insufficient memory after bootup, it prints the log message :  ""Packet Memory buffer test failed!!!  Insufficient packet buffers are available  to continue booting.""

As a result, the Cat3750 CPU cannot receive data from  the outside world, although the switch may continue to forward traffic  between its network ports. When this problem occurs, the console of the  Cat3750 switch will hang, and the following message may be seen  repeatedly in the syslog:  %SUPQ-4-CPUHB_RECV_STARVE: Still seeing receive queue stuck after throttling  In addition, since the CPU is no longer receiving control protocol packets  such as STP BPDUs, it may put all ports into forwarding state. This could  create loops in the network, and cause broadcast storms and network outage.  When the CPU queues are locked up, the user will not be able to issue  commands to reload the switch via CLI or SNMP.

By definition, split-dns isused so that only certain domains get resolved by corporate DNS servers,while rest go to public (ISP assigned) DNS servers. To enforce thisfeature, VPN Client discards all DNS queries that are not part of split-DNSdomain list, and are directed to corporate DNS servers.The problem is when the ISP assigned DNS servers are in the split-networkrange. In that case, all DNS queries are discarded by the VPN Client. Letme explain this with an example:Before VPN Tunnel Establish:Client machine IP Addr: 1.1.1.1/24DNS server: 10.10.10.10/24 After VPN Tunnel Establish:Split-DNS domain: cisco.comsplit-Network (pushed as part of split-tunneling): 10.10.0.0/16Now if end-user pings x.y.z, the client determines that this domain isnot part of split-DNS list (cisco.com), so it should not be tunneled.It discards all DNS queries for x.y.z that are destined for the privatenetwork. The problem is that DNS Servers on the physical adapter (one thatis assigned by the ISP) is in the split-network range. So all DNS querieswould be tunneled, and would thus be discarded by the VPN Client.END RESULTAll DNS queries to domains other than in SPLIT-DNS list would not beresolved. So for our example above, all queries in cisco.com domain wouldbe resolved. But everything else would not be resolved.WORKAROUND1. Fix the misconfiguration. The ISP assigned DNS server should not bein split-network range.2. Don't use split-DNS. Just use split-tunneling, or use all-or-nothingtunneling."," This bug is filed to report a potential misconfiguration in customer  environment.  This happens only if SPLIT-DNS IS ENABLED. By definition, split-dns is used so that only certain domains get resolved by corporate DNS servers, while rest go to public (ISP assigned) DNS servers. To enforce this feature, VPN Client discards all DNS queries that are not part of split-DNS domain list, and are directed to corporate DNS servers.  The problem is when the ISP assigned DNS servers are in the split-network range. In that case, all DNS queries for non split-DNS domains,  are discarded by the VPN Client. Lets see an example for this case:  Before VPN Tunnel Establish: Client machine IP Addr: 10.1.1.1/24 DNS server: 10.2.2.2/24   After VPN Tunnel Establish: Split-DNS domain: cisco.com split-Network (pushed as part of split-tunneling): 10.2.0.0/16  Now if end-user pings x.y.z, the client determines that this domain is not part of split-DNS list (cisco.com), so it should not be tunneled. It discards all DNS queries for x.y.z that are destined for the private network. The problem is that DNS Servers on the physical adapter (one that is assigned by the ISP) is in the split-network range. So all DNS queries would be tunneled, and would thus be discarded by the VPN Client.  END RESULT All DNS queries to domains other than in SPLIT-DNS list would NOT be resolved. So for our example above, all queries in cisco.com domain would be resolved. But everything else would not be resolved.  WORKAROUND 1. Fix the misconfiguration. The ISP assigned DNS server should not be in split-network range.  2. Don't use split-DNS. Just use split-tunneling, or use all-or-nothing tunneling.    "

This is actually spawned from CSCeh45719, in which wecouldnt confirm whether this is a real scaling issue or if therewas any corruption that led to the crash. The loop limit serves the purpose of detecting loops while traversing the memory blocks to make sure that we dont loop around a few blocks for a long time due to corruption.The trip counter (WAY_TOO_MANY_TRIPS) limit currently is 10000000.As the block type is 40bytes, having 10million blocktypesaccount to 400MB of space, which is less one fourth ofthe total memory, and i believe most platforms nearlyallocate 70% of RAM for heap. So this limit of 10000000 may not scale for such higher configurations.There are a few thoughts to handle this:1. One way is to have it configured based on the heap size, as      <heap size carved for the configuration>/<blocktype size> 		(or) 70-80% of the above.   And probably a variable [way_too_many_trips] to be set   with the value above in memory_init() and the macro   WAY_TOO_MANY_TRIPS modified/defined to point to this   variable.2. Or we could probably count the exact number of blocks in the   mempool and use that for ;way too many trips;, but that will   give problems maintaining it amidst the suspends that happen   from processes traversing the block list.3. Or we could make sure that all the pointers (for possible   corruption) are checked properly thereby we can be sure that   there would be no corruption which could lead to a loop, and   hence no need for a counter at all.Diffs for (1) and (2) were tried out and are in the Eng-noteenclosure.", $$IGNORE

He has the following config on the interface=========================interface GigabitEthernet0/1 no ip address duplex full speed 1000 media-type gbic no negotiation auto no cdp enable========================The Gig interface connects to a Non-Cisco device.   The problem can be summarized as follow:- perform a shut on gig interface- show int- interface shows to be admin down- go to connecting device- connecting device still sees carrier from 7206- connecting device in this case is directly connected- connecting device believes that the 7206 is accessible/available- continues to send traffic to 7206- all packets are droppedCustomer claims this is neither standard or desirable behavior because when a SHUT is done on the 7206 NPE-G1 gig interface and the ;TX light; e.g. ;laser; is NOT disabled and is causing his connecting device believes that the 7206 is still active.  In troubleshooting the problem when we connect to a Catalyst 3550, the light is ;Disable; when we 'shut' the interface.  Customer claim other Cisco routers follow this behavior as well.   "," Symptoms: When you enter the shutdownno interface  configuration command on the native Gigabit Ethernet interface of a Cisco NPE-G1 that has the no negotiation autono  command enabled, the Rx LED on the peer interface starts to blink.   Conditions: This symptom is observed on a Cisco 7200 that is connected to a  peer that is configured with a Gigabit Ethernet interface that has Rx and Tx  LEDs and that also has the no negotiation autono  command enabled.   The 7200 NPE-G1 interfaces PHY is emitting signal even when the interace is  admin down.  This keeps the device on the far end potentially in an up/up  state depending on how sensitive that particular hardware PHY is.  Although the Rx light of the affected interface blinks, the interface is in  the up/down state and functions fine.  Workaround: Ensure that both Gigabit Ethernet interfaces have the  negotiation autono command enabled until  negotiation is no longer necessary.   There is no workaround with 'no neg auto' configured if an interface is seeing  signal and is designed to remain down when one side is shut.  If it seeing  signal from the NPE-G1, it may remain in an up/up state.    This issue is also seen on NPE-G2"

CSC.sibu.prods,3750,span-rspan,customer-use,3,0,0,0,CSCeb05555,"RSPAN can leak CDP, DTP, PAgP, and VTP packets onto RSPAN-VLAN","This was discovered during SasquatchCR testing.Lotr1<-->Lotr2Initially, Between Lotr1 and Lotr2  DTP negotiates to trunks (either ISL or Dot1Q).Connect 2 ports on Lotr2 back to back and form a Dot1Q trunk.Then setup a Rspan session on Lotr2 with a source portselected from Dot1Q trunk port.After a while link between Lotr1 to Lotr2 becomes an access link(due to DTP packets were forwarded in Rspan vlan)Also, Lotr1 sees two ports on Lotr2 (internally connected) as theCDP neighbores."," Problem:  This problem exists on Catalyst 3750 switches running 12.1(11)AX software.  When using the Remote SPAN feature (RSPAN), local link control packets such as BPDUs, CDP packets, etc. should not be forwarded to the RSPAN-vlan.  A problem exists on the C3750 in that RSPAN incorrectly spans all packets with a destination mac address of 0100.0CCC.CCCC. This includes packets from, among others, CDP, DTP, PAgP, VTP, and UDLD.  These packets will be tagged with the RSPAN-vlan id, and will then be forwarded on any trunk ports carrying the RSPAN-vlan.  As a result, trunk ports carrying the RSPAN-vlan will see control packets from the RSPAN source ports along with their own local control packets. This can result in confusion and improper operation of these protocols on those trunk ports.  Some possible symptoms of this bug:  - CDP can incorrectly list as a neighbor a switch that was actually a neighbor on the original RSPAN source port.  - DTP may fail to work properly on trunks that are carrying the RSPAN-vlan.  - PAgP may fail to work properly on etherchannels that are carrying the RSPAN-vlan.  - VTP may incorrectly propagate VTP pruning messages on the wrong interface.  For example, a pruning message intended for an RSPAN source port could also appear on the trunk port carrying the RSPAN-vlan.  Workarounds:  1) Prune the RSPAN-vlan from all trunk ports where it is not needed. This can be done, for example, with the command switchport trunk allowed vlan exceptNo CmdArgrspan-vlan-idNoCmdArg.  2) Do not use DTP on trunks carrying the RSPAN-vlan.  Instead, use the commands: switchport trunk encapsulationNo  CmdArgencapsulation-typeNoCmdArg, switchport mode trunkNo, and switchport nonegotiateNo.  3) Do not use PAgP on trunks carrying the RSPAN-vlan.  Instead use the command channel-groupNo  CmdArgchannel-numberNoCmdArg mode onNo to form the etherchannel without negotiation.  4) Be aware that CDP can sometimes give erroneous results.  If necessary, disable CDP, no cdp enableNo, on all interfaces used as RSPAN sources.  5) Be aware that VTP pruning messages may be propagated in error.  6) Be aware that UDLD and any other protocol using destination mac address 0100.0CCC.CCCC may not operate properly on trunk ports carrying the RSPAN-vlan.

Thus 3750 sees fololowing packets from, them:[ip header]->[malformed TCP header with bogus offset and date] [FCS].For some TCP packets data offset (in TCP field) may point beyond the frame (thus tcp data offset if out of the frame).Such frames will be dropped by 3750 (other swtiches like 3550 do not notice this).

Workaround: There is no workaround at this time for the affected devices listed above.  The device fragmenting the packet should be reconfigured, if possible, to not fragment the TCP header.  Additional Information: This problem might occur if the 3750 is forwarding packets that have an encrypted TCP header, or if a packet is fragmented, and the TCP header has been fragmented into two different Ethernet frames.  When using 12.2(25)SED1 or later, these packets that used to be dropped will now be sent in the software forwarding path.  They will not be sent through the hardware forwarding path.  The number of packets that can be sent in the software forwarding path are significantly lower than what is possible in the hardware forwarding path.

After deleting VRF XXX using  no ip vrf XXXno, trying to add VRF XXX again may not work  because the the previous delete might not have completely removed VRF from the  router. When this problem happens, the sh runno output  doesn't show the VRF, but the nosh ip vrfno command shows  the VRF XXX as *deleted (waiting to be deleted).   Conditions: When VRF is deleted using no ip vrf nameno  command, it will be put in *deleted state AND after all the routes are cleared  in the VRF table, it will be deleted from the router. If it stays in *deleted  state forever, that means for some reason routing protocol has failed to clear  the route in the VRF table. The sh ip route vrf nameno  command will not show anything, but show ip cef vrf nameno  command would show CEF entries, in this case. NOTE: Entries stuck in CEF table is only one of the reasons for the VRF not  getting deleted from the box.  Workaround: The only way to clear the *deleted VRF is by reloading the router.     "

This is possible if the global switching mode has not been applied to that linecard at the time when Online Diag tests are being performed on it. The above mentioned tests verify the functionality of the rewrite ASIC, which in the described case will not be in sync. Online Diags however assumes the ASIC is in sync because the global switching mode indicates ""truncated"" (a mix of legacy/bus-only and at least 2 Constellation+ modules is present in the system). But the linecard at that point is still in bus-only mode, hence the above tests will fail.  The fix is described in the Eng-Note enclosure.  Workaround:  Run Online Diags from CLI via the ""diagn start mod mod-# test test-#"" command once the module is online - the tests should now pass.  "

MBUS  message loss is usually extremely rare, but not impossible. If the lost  messages happen to be MBUS C2W programming messages, they may cause  inconsistencies in the MBUS Agent C2W programming. If the inconsistency  happens to affect a single bay's SPA EEPROM C2W device, then it becomes  impossible to determine the type of the SPA inserted in that bay. The LC  crashes cause very high peaks of MBUS activity, which apparently may cause  MBUS message loss (suspecting buffer overrun or out-of-buffer conditions).   "

SSH is a memory-intensive feature, which consequently limits the number of  VLANs, trunk ports, and cluster members that may be configured on the  Catalyst 2950 according to the following restrictions:  *The multiplicative product of the number of trunk ports and VLANs must be  less than or equal to 128 [i.e. (# of trunks)*(# of VLANs) must be less  than or equal to 128].  Thus, if there are 2 trunks on the switch, up to 64  VLANs can be configured (2*64=128).  *If your  Catalyst 2950 switch is also configured as a cluster commander  switch, the cryptographic image can only support up to 8 cluster members in  the cluster.  There is no limitation on the use of other features.  If a switch, which has previously saved configurations exceeding the above restrictions, is loaded with the 2950 Cryptographic software, unpredictable behavior, such as continuous reloads, may occur when system memory is completely running out.  If the following message is observed with the Cryptographic software:  %SYS-2-MALLOCFAIL: Memory allocation of (number_of_bytes) bytes failed ...  It is possible that the configurations already exceed the restrictions. Please check the configurations to make sure the above restrictions are not exceeded. "

These feature specific show commands are neither consistent nor intuitive to use. For an example, if we want to know amount of TCAM used by mac-addresses and how much still left, you can use the ;show mac-address-table count | inc space available; command. For multicast L3 we have ;show platform ip multicast counters; where the ATM info displayed gives the actual information you are looking for. Similarly for l2 multicast, ;show platform ip igmp snoop counter; gives the TCAM used so far through ;atm; column.  We need to provide a global show platform command to display the amount ofTCAM used/left for all features on the whole system. In addition, we need toindicate to the user whether any of the features (e.g. ACL or Unicast Routing)exceed its TCAM allocation and result in packets to be forwarded in software.This new global show platform command should be included as part of the;show tech-support; output so that we can easily determine whether theproblems customers report are due to TCAM full condition.", This is an enhancement request to show actual TCAM usage on the 3750/3760  platforms.

One of the customer is using InfoBlox DNSOne DHCP server which has a potential bug, when replying client's DHCP request with option82 data, it will replace existing option82 with an invalid formated circuit/remote id suboption data. The snooping code always assumes the server reply is in properly TLV formated and didn't validate the suboption in TLV format. The mapped length byte is no longer valid and cause the system to crash when trying to memcpy the suboption data with that length."," None Symptom:  If a DHCP server does not handle option 82 properly and sends a DHCP reply with a malformed option 82 the switch with DHCP snooping enabled could crash. This happens because the switch assumes the option 82 to be properly formed and tries accessing the fields in the packet. Certain malformation could cause the switch to crash.  Conditions:  If there is a DHCP server which don't support option 82, e.g. Microsoft DHCP server,  then the bug won't affect them. If they use DHCP server which support option 82 correctly, e.g. Cisco CNR, then it won't be an issue as well. Only if they use a DHCP server which would send invalid format of option 82 data, then they have a potential to trigger this bug.  This bug for Catalyst6500 could be seen on 12.2(18)SXE releases onwards if DHCP snooping and option 82 is enabled and the customer network has a DHCP server which sends out invalid format of option 82 data.

To see the problem, perform the following steps:1.  Bring up a redundant system in SSO mode, running a crypto image.2.  Create a crypto key on the active with ;crypto key generate rsa;.3.  Verify that the key exists on the active and standby with the    ;show crypto key mypubkey rsa; command.4.  Do a ;write; to write out the private-config.5.  Reload both supervisors with ;redundancy reload shelf;.6.  The key is loaded from the private-config on the active, but is    not synced to the standby.  The ;show crypto key mypubkey rsa;    command will show a key on the active, but no key on the standby.At this point, if a switchover occurs, SSH will be disabled due to thelack of a crypto key.The basic problem here is a result of the fact that the crypto key ischeckpointed from the active to the standby only when it is created fromthe CLI.  Two possible approaches to fixing:1.  We could create an RF client for the crypto code and have it sync    the key from active to standby as part of the bulk dynamic state    sync during bootup.2.  We might be able to find the parser code that handles the different    CLI that is written to/read from the private config and sync the    keys over then as well.I (Kyle) have discussed a bit of the first option with Ken Hiremath, sohe might have some more useful input on that approach."," Symptoms: After an SSO switchover occurs, RSA keys are lost on a Cisco  Catalyst 4500.

CSC.sys,3560,hw-power,customer-use,3,0,0,0,CSCeh20636,Switch latches on brownouts of 40-300 msec duration for 110 & 220 power,"This problem exists on 3560/3750-PWR (10/100 SKUs only) when customer has an inconsistent power source. That is, brownouts may occur on occasions. The problem is that upon a brownout, the switch shuts down completely and does not come back up. The only way to recover is to either switch the power off/on at the wall, or pull the power out of the back of the switch.Tried recreating this issue in the TAC lab with one of our 3560's. However, I could not reproduce the problem.Obtained one of the 4 or 5 customer's 3560s that exhibited the problem. Using the customer's 3560, I was able to immediately reproduce the problem. The problem was reporduced by very quickly yanking the power out of the 3560 power socket ( only slightly ) and then plugging back in again. The was to basically try and simulate a brownout. The switch would power down and would not come back even though the power cord was fully plugged in and connected.BU has requested a bug be opened and the switch be shipped to them for detailed analysis."," $$IGNORE  A small number of customers have reported a power supply latch-up condition in the Catalyst 3560-24PS that requires user  intervention to recover. We have traced the issue to a condition within  a specific power supply used in the 3560-24PS. Specifically a sub  one second power dip or power outage can cause the power supply to  enter a safety shutdown state requiring a power cycle to resume normal  function. This condition can happen when the 3560-24PS is operating in an  environment where the mains-power is 110 or 220 volts.   All well engineered power supplies have built-in mechanisms to protect  from externally induced mains-power anomalies. Industry standards specify  tolerable ranges for power line anomalies. All power supplies used in the  Catalyst 3560-24PS meet these requirements. In this specific case the power supply is entering a latch-up condition as it cycles too quickly  through the auto ranging function. The latch-up condition is easily cleared by  power cycling the device.   The best solution for this type of issue is to ensure consistent power is available  to the device, as most equipment will fail or reset with this type of power anomaly.  In this case the undesirable consequence is that user intervention will be required  to clear the condition.  Again, this will only happen with power dips of  between 40 msec and 300 msec, for  mains-power of 110 & 220 VAC."

CSC.netbu,gss,platform,customer-use,3,0,0,0,CSCeg62247,Investigate whether GSS should run check disk periodicially,"On rare occasion, the customer will notice that the GSS takes a very longtime to reboot in a normal scenario (i.e. clean reboot).  This is due to the'Maximum Mount Count' being hit on one of the partitions (usually STATE)and therefore the kernel forces a Check Disk.  (examine with 'tune2fs -l /dev/hda11')The STATE partition is the main reason for concern because it is very large andtakes a really long time to check.  It appears that the maximum mount count is set to 25 in the default install of GSS software.  The question is why?Is there any reason it should be set at all?  It appears on modern versionsof RedHat (anything past 7.2), the Maximum Mount count is set to -1, whichmeans that no Check Disk will be performed periodically when the partitionis mounted.  The partition will still be checked if it was not unmountedcleanly (hard power cycle).I would suggest we investigate this and see if there is any reason at allto peform periodic check disks in non-error scenarios. My impression is that is unnecessary, but that could be because modernRedHat distros use journalling filesystems by default.  The 4480 and 4490do not (and probably never will) whereas the 4491 does use journalling.It seems like a bad thing if the GSS takes a very long time to reboot undernormal circumstances.  Even if this only occurs once every 25 reboots, itis too much."," Symptom: With this bug fix the following message is seen on console only on the release older that GSS410  EXT3-fs warning: maximal mount count reached, running e2fsck is recommended  Release GSS410 should not see this message.

The symptom includes *all* of the following:  a. unable to reach the switch via telnet/ping b. unable to access the switch via snmp or other management applications. c. able to reach the MSFC via telnet/ping d. when connected via console, nothing is output or some    garbled (repeating character 'R' or '.' or some other character)    characters output e. System status LED is normal (green) and Backplane utilisation LED at    0%. In some cases, Traffic meter LED may be at 100%. f. System has been up for approximately 7 months.  Platform /releases affected: =========================== Only Sup2   Workaround/Fix: ==============  This caveat has been fixed in 7.6(5).   Single Supervisor: ==================  Currently the only known workaround is to schedule a maintainance window to reset the supervisor when the uptime is closer to 150 days. The uptime can be viewed via show systemNo or  show versionNo.  Dual Supervisor: ================  In Dual Sup scenarios, the other sup will takeover in 10 minutes.  However, if required a maintainance window can be scheduled to do the following:  If HA is not enabled, enable HA using set system highavailability enableno. Wait for HA to sync. show system highavailability no should say 'ON' for Highavailability Operational-status.   1. switch to the other supervisor  using switch supervisor    "

Database As you can see, the cpu dropped from 70% to almost 0%!! Bottom line is: too much priority is given to the ""squeeze operation"" and this is hurting the maintainability from our routers! Please do NOT close this DDTS or even worse, please don't ""JUNK"" it!BTW this problem can be reproduced with 12.1(14)E too..."," You may see during the operation of a 'squeeze slotX:', that the CPU utilization  will go to at least 90% for multiple minutes and causes other processes to be  starved.   WORKAROUND:  Because of this problem the squeeze process should be run during a  maintenance window. "

code (0x001C)!, PC 0x8055D560  Conditions: It is believed that the problem is caused by a ""brown-out"", that is, a substantial reduction in the voltage (but not a complete loss of power) supplied to the switch by the customer's power system.  Workaround: Insure that the power supplied to the switch is reliable.  Additional Information: The power supply in the Cisco Catalyst 2950G is tested to meet the requirements of IEC61000-4-11 (Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) - Part 4-11: Testing and measurement techniques - Voltage dips, short interruptions and voltage variations immunity tests).  This problem was only seen when the voltage was reduced to very low levels. "
CSC.workgrp,cat6000,x6748-sfp,customer-use,3,0,0,0,CSCeh46046,Disbaled 67xx-SFP ports after reboot lose connectivity if re-enabled,"If a port is booted into disable state (via oir, reboot) you *must* toggle the negotiationstate of that port before remote end will become connected.  Once the port gets connected,all your normal operation will work (enable/disable clear config and reconfigure) on thatport.  As long as the port is *not* in disabled state before a reboot (oir, reboot), portwill remain operation even after a reboot.  If port were in disable state before a reboot,you'd have to toggle the negotiation state after a reboot.  This problem can be reproducedon 6748-SFP and 6724-SFP.

Conditions:- The switch might crash while establishing SSH connection to client using SSH version-2. The crash may be seen only if SSH version-2 is enabled on Catalyst 6K and SSH client tries to connect to Catalyst 6K using SSH version-2. But the chances are very low.   Workaround: The workaround is to disable SSHv2 and use SSH version-1 by setting ssh mode to V1. Or if the customer can switch to Telnet instead of SSH, then clearing the crypto key using ""clear crypto key rsa "" will prevent this crash.  The fix will be available in 8.3(4) release. As an alternative use telnet or SSHv1.    "

CSC.sys,cat6000,cat6000-ipc,customer-use,2,0,0,1,CSCeg11009,Avoid data plane packets from reaching the control plane,"This is the ISBU portion of the bug.  We want to separate the control planefrom the data plane completely.  The IPC team portion of the bug is trackedunder CSCeg05087.Solution overview:------------------Per my discussion with Peter (oriordan) and Huaqing (hzeng), we would liketo fix this security loop hole ASAP.  Therefore, we will not wait for the IPCsolutions.  We will accomodate their fix to our branch (pikespeak) when theirfix is ready.  However, we may not patch this fix back to cosmos_e unless thereis a strong business needs for it.[1] Add an eobc_raw_enqueue that is similar to the general raw_eneuque.  Sinceit is EOBC specific and works only in EOBC, it is simpler than raw_enqueue.[2] In order to minimize the impact to other platformss (e.g., 7200), we willnot remove the reg_add from the ipc_server.c (function ipc_init).  Our solutionis to do a reg_delete in the platform code to remove the reg_add that is doneby the IPC.[3] SCP will be hooked to eobc_raw_enqueue, not raw_enqueue.  [4] The EOBC drivers will post the packet using eobc_raw_enqueue (instead ofraw_enqueue).Item [2] and [3] allows us to remove the SCP and IPC from the data plane anditem [4] hooks IPC and SCP to the eobc dirvers.Problem Description:--------------------When a fake IPC packet is received on the data plane, Cat6k inband driver justcalls raw_enqueue.  This basically pushes the fake IPC packets on to the IPC subsystem.  Since the data in the fake IPC packet does not confrom to the IPCpacket format, the IPC reveive function ipc_process_raw_pak drops the packet, claiming the packet contains a wrong IPC zone information.For the details of related customer case, see CSCef95789 and CSCeg03808.There are two problems here, and we would like to ask the IPC team to followup on them.[1] The IPC sybsystem should not call reg_add_raw_enqueue to register the IPCpacket type.  Otherwise, the data plane receive routines that call raw_enqueuemay push data plane packets onto IPC.  This is a security hole.  Per my (binzhang) conversation with Bala (cbala), the IPC team will try to do that.We will adopt the GSR's solution, where the control plane receive routine willdirectly invoke ipc_process_raw_pak.[2] The IPC Ethertype 0x200F may not belong to Cisco.  A quick search found that the type may belong to other company.  It is not clear if there is any issue here since the control plane packets do not get onto the Internet (i.e.,inside box), but the smart move is not to use it if possible.  Again, it isup to the IPC team to figure it out.--Bin",  Symptoms:  Platforms that support IPC may show IPC-2-INVALIDZONE error message:  Conditions:  This condition is not performance impacting  Workaround:  There is no workaround for this issue. 
CSC.sys,c2600,c2600,customer-use,2,0,0,0,CSCdy78397,AMDP2_FE-3-RXOVERFLO msg severely degrades performance on 2600,"When overdriving an FE interface on the 2600, a recent introductionof the message AMDP2_FE-3-RXOVERFLO causes severe degradation.In other words, when the box is already at max, the act ofprinting the message causes a feedback such that the maximumframe rate is at least halved.  This kind of feedback is unstable and causes a kind of severe disruption that couldpotentially make the system come to a standstill.  For instance,if a large FTP transfer is occuring when the box is near limits,it might push it over the edge.  Since TCP handles the lostpackets, it will attempt retransmits, hence making the trafficsituation even worse (until slow-start or windowing back offenough or the session times out).Before this message, any overdriving would cause a minordegradation of the max throughput in a linear way.  For instance,on a box with 18k throughput, driving 20k through may resultin throughput of about 17.5k.  Driving 30k through results inmaybe 16k.  This slight degradation is due to error handlingand is to be expected.However, afterh the message, overdriving a box by only 1kcauses a degradation of upto 10k.  For instance, overdrivingthe box to 19k causes an throughput of only 8k.  This canresult in massive drops during bursty episodes instead ofjust a few drops.  Hence, due to retries, the bursty episodescan become much more severe.It is easier to describe this behavior with a graph.The following were measured with 64byte packets usingSmartbits or IXIA.

Details about affected scenarios follow...   1. ingress vlan MARKING for Bridged multicast traffic subjected to multicast Routing  Multicast traffic bridged on ingress vlan is correctly marked ONLY if does NOT hit a FIB entry.  Under above conditions, multicast stream is bridged but no routing is performed in hardware via (S,G) or (*,G) entry.  In presence of (S,G) or (*,G) hardware entries, ingress vlan marking for bridged multicast traffic does NOT work.  Workaround: disable multicast hardware switching on ingress interface using ""no mls ip multicast"" command   2. ingress interface MARKING for Routed multicast traffic  If QOS policy is configured  to mark multicast traffic coming-in from a specific interface AND if related (S,G) or (*,G) hardware entry IS present:  - under INGRESS replication mode, ingress marking does work - under EGRESS replication mode, ingress marking does NOT work  Workaround: force multicast hardware switching to INGRESS replication mode   3. egress interface POLICING for Routed multicast traffic  Under EGRESS replication mode POLICING of multicast replicated traffic does NOT work in a reliable way, hence it's NOT supported.  Workaround: force multicast hardware switching to INGRESS replication mode "

Deleted that card . Retriving Conditions in the CTC Conditions pane showed ""Payload Bus Errors"" agains Slot # 2 . Reproduced it on Slot # 13 as well.Sequence to reproduce : 1.Insert a Smart Filler. 2.Provision/Change the card type to OC48 3.Let the card sit there for a while for some time (2-3 mins) 4.Delete the card . 	Problem : i.   Filler Card will not be repainted on the CTC eventhough it is physically in the slot.		  ii.  Card Presence Indicator finds the card alright but not the showModules.		  iii. Payload Bus Failures will be raised against the card but will only be in CTC conditions		       tab and not on TSC.

Customer is migrating several vrf into one and thus has been adding/changing import/export statements. The customer upgraded code to 12.2(18)S2 on his 7206 routers and 12.0(26)S1 on his GSR routers. Most PE routers are 7206 while some are GSR. P routers are GSR. The upgrade happened on 1/16-17 of January 2004. This problem has cropped up since then. Also customer is performing migration so we have two changes happening. So far this issue has only occured on the 7206 routers.On two occasions customer has had loss of connectivty. The latest happened to a Hong Kong router which has show commands gathered in the case notes. The other occurence was in Singapore. The changes to the Hong Kong router were made a couple of weeks ago and so it does not appear that making a change triggers the issue.I asked the customer to send me the show tech and show logs/syslogs from the Hong Kong router from the time of the failure.Action Plan*******************************1) I will look for known issues in the 7206 and GSR versions of code2) I will file a bug if no solid hit found3) Need to set customer up with a Cisco Live login.*** EMAIL RECEIVED AND UPDATED IN CASE NOTES AT 02/10/2004 09:13:11 *** EMAIL OUT 02/10/2004 06:53:24 PM bpayment Action Type: Email OutSend to: [ccolmenares2@houston.sns.slb.com, sullah@houston.sns.slb.com]Sana,Here is the current status on your case.

CSC.sys,all,eigrp,customer-use,3,0,0,0,CSCed96206,Crash after <no neighbor> command,"&lt;snip&gt;I have some idea what causes the crash.  I think the problem exists in         the mainline branches also.  We can retry with 121E mainline or 123            mainline and file the bug after we get some more idea how it effects           other branches.  It maybe fixed or masked in the newer branches than           121E.  It's not likely that the customer will run into this bug though.                                                                                       The crash happens due to a race condition when the script repeatedly           issues the 'neighbor x.x.x.x' and 'clear ip ei nei' and 'no neighbor           x.x.x.x' command.

CSC.sys,all,ios-cm,customer-use,3,0,0,0,CSCed40072,FXS port uses H323 instead of MGCP after reload or reset of gateway,"The customer has Cisco CallManager 3.3(2)fp10 and a 3640 gateway with an NM-HDAusing several FXS ports.  The gateway is configured to use MGCP with ""ccm-manager config""and to fallback to H.323 when the CallManager is unreachable.The problem is that sometimes when the customer goes offhook on one of the analogphones connected to the NM-HDA's FXS port, the call will hit the H.323 dial-peerwhich is configured for fallback.  In this case, the default application (H.323)is invoked instead of the expected MGCP application.This problem can occur when the gateway is configured to use ""ccm-manager config""with CallManager fallback to H.323.  The problem is triggered when the the gatewayis reloaded or the gateway is reset from Cisco CallManager and the dial-peers arereordered so that the H.323 dial-peers are listed first sequentially in the gateway'srunning configuration.As long as the MGCP dial-peers are listed before the H.323 fallback dial-peers inthe configuration everything works as expected.  However, in any of the followingthree situations, the dial-peers may get reordered so that the H.323 dial-peer islisted first in the configuration and the MGCP dial-peers get removed and readdedat the end of the running configuration due to ""ccm-manager config"".1. This problem may occur when the gateway is reloaded using the ""reload"" command 2. This problem may occur when the gateway is reset from CallManager's CCMAdmin web page.3. This problem may occur when the gateway re-registers to CallManager after    there has been a true network failure and the gateway had to fallback to H.323After some lab testing discussed below, I was able to come to the above mentioned conclusion.I found that when you are using MGCP fallback to H.323, you must use one of the following two options.1.  Configure the H.323 settings (destination-pattern, incoming called number, etc) and ""application mgcpapp"" on the same dial peer as seen in the two CCO docs listed below.http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk652/tk701/technologies_configuration_example09186a008012ecc6.shtmlhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk652/tk701/technologies_tech_note09186a0080144630.shtmlOR2. ALWAYS configure the mgcpapp dial-peer BEFORE the H.323 dial-peerIn the lab, I created the following 2 dial-peers to match the  customer's setup.=====dial-peer voice 999200 pots  application mgcpapp  port 2/0/0!dial-peer voice 8 pots  description HDA DN 1403; Fax Toller General 1 (H.323 Fallback Mode)  preference 1  destination-pattern 1403  progress_ind alert enable 8  progress_ind progress enable 8  progress_ind connect enable 8  fax rate disable  port 2/0/0=====However, with the above configuration, I was unable to reproduce the  problem and my call from an analog phone to IP phone completed  successfully.Then, I noticed that in the customer's configuration, they had the  H.323 fallback dial-peer for their fax port listed first and the  mgcpapp dial-peer for this fax machine listed later.Therefore, I changed the order of the above dial-peers to thefollowing.=====dial-peer voice 8 pots  description HDA DN 1403; Fax Toller General 1 (H.323 Fallback Mode)  preference 1  destination-pattern 1403  progress_ind alert enable 8  progress_ind progress enable 8  progress_ind connect enable 8  fax rate disable  port 2/0/0!dial-peer voice 999200 pots  application mgcpapp  port 2/0/0=====Then, the call failed as soon as I attempted the call from my analog  phone to the IP phone.  I could see from the ""debug voip ccapi inout"" that we were matching the ""dial-peer voice 8 pots"" and hitting the default session application which is always H.323.I then tried the configuration with all of the configuration under one dial-peer and it worked fine as well.  See my configuration below.=====dial-peer voice 999200 pots  description HDA DN 1403; Fax Toller General 1 (H.323 Fallback Mode)  preference 1  application mgcpapp  destination-pattern 1403  progress_ind alert enable 8  progress_ind progress enable 8  progress_ind connect enable 8  fax rate disable  port 2/0/0=====Therefore, the rule of thumb is to make sure that the mgcp dial-peer isalways listed first in the running configuration OR just put the  mgcpapp and H.323 configuration on the same dial-peer as described in the documentation listed above.  If the H.323 dial-peer is listed first in the configuration, then the call WILL BE handled by H.323 and NOT mgcp.Upon further investigation, I determined that the customer had ""ccm-manager config""enabled and that during the gateway reset or reload the MGCP dial-peers wereremoved from the running configuration and after the TFTP download of theXML configuration file these MGCP dial-peers were re-added at the end of thegateway's running configuration.  This is exactly what triggered this problem.This bug appears to be exactly the same as CSCdv41462.  However, CSCdv41462 was apparently fixed in 12.1(1).  It appears that this problem has resurfaced.Another similar DDTS is CSCeb08888.  However, the DE for this bug said that thebug fix for CSCeb08888 only included the fix for digital interfaces and thatis the reason why was still seeing this problem with the NM-HDA in IOS version12.3(5a)."," Symptom:  A call from an analog phone will fail with reorder tone upon dialing the first digit of a number.  The running configuration of the gateway will list the H.323 dial-peers before the MGCP dial-peers.  Also ""debug voip ccapi inout"" will indicate that the call is hitting the default application which is H.323 instead of hitting the MGCP application.  Condition:  This problem may occur with the following configuration. -An analog phone is connected to an FXS port of an NM-HDA in an IOS gateway -The gateway is configured with ""ccm-manager config"" AND MGCP fallback to H.323  The problem is triggered when one of the following conditions are met. 1. The gateway is reloaded using the command ""reload"" 2. The gateway is reset from the CallManager Administration web page 3. The gateway re-registers with CallManager after losing its network connectivity to CallManagers and falling back to H.323.  During the re-registration process, the gateway will delete the MGCP dial-peers, download the MGCP XML configuration from the CallManager's TFTP server, and  re-add the MGCP dial-peers at the end of the running configuration.  Therefore, when the analog phone goes offhook and dials the first digit on the  FXS port, the call will immediately and incorrectly hit the H.323 dial-peer  (since it is listed before the MGCP dial-peer) and reorder tone will be played.  Workaround:  First disable ""ccm-manager config"" by issuing ""no ccm-manager config"" in global configuration mode.  Then ensure that all of the MGCP dial-peer are listed first in the running configuration.  If they are not, then you will need to manually remove and readd the H.323 dial-peers so that they are listed AFTER the MGCP dial-peers in the  running configuration. "

I suspect this is a bug, becausefurther up, you call fr_swidb_setup directly. You should removethis reg_add call, drop the second parameter to fr_swidb_setup,and only call fr_swidb_setup when you allocate a new frame relayswidb.Conceptually, subblocks should be quite dynamic and self-contained,in that they should be added and deleted according to theconfiguration of the router. Unnecessary subblocks should notbe added, because this simply uses up memory. Subblocks shouldalways be deleted using a correct destroy vector, becausewe want to get to a point when IDBs can be allocated and freedsafely, and the first step to doing this is to ensure thatthe subblocks hanging off IDBs are always able to be deletedwith impunity.Also, I cannot see where this subblock is ever removed, if theswidb is deallocated or the encapsulation is changedto something besides frame relay. It is OK to add thesubblock, but it also has to be removed if the swidb nolonger is attached as a FR idb.  The destroy vectorwill do this if the swidb is deleted, or idb_init_allis called.&gt;  }&gt;  &gt;  &gt;===========================================================================&gt;&gt;COMMAND: ccdiff -cp /vob/ios.sys4/sys/wan/frame_relay.h@@/main/del_t/7 /view/panthony-CSCds09065-64bit/vob/ios.sys4/sys/wan/frame_relay.h&gt;Index: sys/wan/frame_relay.h&gt;===========================================================================&gt;*** /vob/ios.sys4/sys/wan/frame_relay.h@@/main/del_t/7	Sun Oct 29 00:53:00 2000&gt;--- /view/panthony-CSCds09065-64bit/vob/ios.sys4/sys/wan/frame_relay.h	Fri Jan 12 17:39:58 2001&gt;*************** typedef struct fr_plisttype_ {&gt;*** 71,76 ****&gt;--- 71,78 ----&gt;  &gt;  #define LINK_COMPRESSED_IP     LINK_UNCOMPRESSED_TCP&gt;  &gt;+ #define FR_MAX_CACHED_CTR_TIME    (2 * ONESEC)&gt;+ &gt;  #define HSSI_FACTOR     4  /* multiply defaults for HSSI interface */&gt;  &gt;   &gt;*************** typedef struct fr_comp_opts_ {&gt;*** 189,194 ****&gt;--- 191,219 ----&gt;   */&gt;  #define DISTRIBUTED_FR_SWITCHES_XDR_LEN (sizeof(ipc_ipfast_fr_info) + 6) &gt;  &gt;+ /* FR_ADD_64BIT_CNTRS&gt;+  * add cntrs in src to cntrs in dst&gt;+  */&gt;+ #define FR_ADD_64BIT_CNTRS(src, dst) {           \&gt;+         dst-&gt;in_bytes64 += src-&gt;in_bytes64;      \&gt;+         dst-&gt;out_bytes64 += src-&gt;out_bytes64;    \&gt;+         dst-&gt;in_pkts64 += src-&gt;in_pkts64;        \&gt;+         dst-&gt;out_pkts64 += src-&gt;out_pkts64;      \&gt;+ }&gt;+ &gt;+ &gt;+ #define FR_UPDATE_64BIT_VC_CNTR(pvc, cur_64_val, cur_val, last_val) { \&gt;+ 	fr_pvc_stats_type *stats = &(pvc-&gt;pvc_stats); \&gt;+ 	if (cur_val &gt; stats-&gt;last_val) {\&gt;+ 	    pvc-&gt;cntrs_64bit.cur_64_val += (cur_val - stats-&gt;last_val); \&gt;+ 	    stats-&gt;last_val = cur_val; \&gt;+         } \&gt;+         else if (cur_val &lt; stats-&gt;last_val) { \&gt;+ 	    pvc-&gt;cntrs_64bit.cur_64_val += \&gt;+ 		((((uint32)(~0)) - stats-&gt;last_val) + cur_val); \&gt;+ 	    stats-&gt;last_val = cur_val; \&gt;+         } \&gt;+ }&gt;  &gt;  typedef struct fr_q933_hdr_ {&gt;  	ushort dlci;&gt;*************** typedef struct fr_pvc_stats_type_ {&gt;*** 454,461 ****&gt;--- 479,533 ----&gt;      ulong num_cllm_pkts;&gt;      ulong num_pkts_broad;&gt;      ulong num_bytess_broad;&gt;+     /*&gt;+      * total bytes in and out last time we checked.

CSC.sys,3750,platform-sw,customer-use,2,0,0,0,CSCee88632,SFP interface down down after OIR,"This DDTS concerns SFP modules, GLC-SX-MM= (800-23859-01), with the following serial numbers:AGS081305GW, AGS081305G3, AGS081305H9, AGS08130524,AGS081305HG, AGS081305GH, AGS0813054E, AGS08130543,AGS081305GX, AGS081305HC The symptoms described below are seen in the DSBU customer escalation lab.Removal and the immediate reinsertion (OIR) of these SFP modules results in the SFP's GE interface going down down (not connected). Waiting around 60 seconds between removal and reinsertion generally results in an up up (connected) interface state. However, I have observed instances where waiting any amount of time between removal and reinsertion of the SFP does not prevent the occurrence of the down down (not connected) state.A ""shutdown"" followed by a ""no shutdown"" of the interface or a software reload of the switch brings the SFP's GE interface from down down (not connected) back up to the up up (connected) state.Other GLC-SX-MM modules available in the DSBU customer escalation lab generally do not exhibit this behavior although I have observed instanceswhere any SFP is in the down down state after OIR.Testing was performed in the DSBU customer escalation lab using a WS-C2970G-24TS-E running 12.2(20)SE. I see the behavior with the following SFP configurations: Tx looped to Rx on the same SFP, two SFP's fibered together on the same C2970, and SFP's fibered together between the C2970 and a C3750.  I recommend DSBU engineering witness the behavior in the DSBU customer escalation lab.The configuration of the C2970 is shown below:Switch#sh verCisco Internetwork Operating System Software IOS (tm) C2970 Software (C2970-I6L2-M), Version 12.2(20)SE, RELEASESOFTWARE (fc1)Copyright (c) 1986-2004 by cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Wed 19-May-04 11:02 by yenanhImage text-base: 0x00003000, data-base: 0x007D1BFCROM: Bootstrap program is C2970 boot loaderBOOTLDR: C2970 Boot Loader (C2970-HBOOT-M) Version 12.1(14)EA1, RELEASESOFTWARE (fc1)Switch uptime is 6 minutesSystem returned to ROM by power-onSystem image file is ""flash:c2970-i6l2-mz.122-20.SE.bin""cisco WS-C2970G-24TS-E (PowerPC405) processor (revision B0) with118784K/12280K bytes of memory.Processor board ID CSG0801P068Last reset from power-on1 Virtual Ethernet/IEEE 802.3  interface(s)28 Gigabit Ethernet/IEEE 802.3 interface(s)The password-recovery mechanism is enabled.512K bytes of flash-simulated non-volatile configuration memory.Base ethernet MAC Address       : 00:0E:D7:54:38:80Motherboard assembly number     : 73-9095-03Power supply part number        : 341-0045-01Motherboard serial number       : CAT07520SJ4Power supply serial number      : LIT07460069Model revision number           : B0Motherboard revision number     : A0Model number                    : WS-C2970G-24TS-ESystem serial number            : CSG0801P068Top Assembly Part Number        : 800-24261-01Top Assembly Revision Number    : B0Hardware Board Revision Number  : 0x02Switch   Ports  Model              SW Version              SWImage            ------   -----  -----              ----------             ----------          *    1   28     WS-C2970G-24TS-E   12.2(20)SE             C2970-I6L2-M        Configuration register is 0xF"," Symptom:      The SFP's interface on Catalyst 2970, Catalyst 3560, Catalyst 3750,      and Catalyst ME-3750 switches might be set to down/down after an OIR      of the SFP.      1.

Workaround/Solution      Following are the field workarounds for this problem:      It has been observed in almost all such incidents that the command sequence      ""shutdown"" followed by ""no shutdown"" resolves the problem for platforms:      c2970/c3560/c3750. Re-booting the switch resolves the issue for the     ME-3750.  Resolution:      Upgrading the software to Cisco IOS Release 12.2(20)SE1 or later image      resolves the issue for platforms: c2970/c3560/c3750.

CSC.labtrunk,cat4000,cat4000,customer-use,3,0,0,0,CSCef89979,No available hardware TCAM entries - message is repeated many times,"Topology------------dgcpserver(7200) --------- dhcprelay(4510-DUT) -------- dhcpclient (4510)Image------------Version 12.2(25)EW(1.44) alpha-enhExpected Behavior-------------------When there is a TCAM entries limit hit, the warning message should be rate-limited.Description----------------The dhcprelay is 4510 with 7 Theos and 1 Velcro (10th slot).  All the 384 portsfrom the line module slots are connected to the dhcpclient.  The dhcpclient isa 4510 and has 7 Velcros and 1 Theo (10th slot).  Both the switches has Vadersupervisor.  The SFP port from the dhcprelay is connected to the dhcpserver.The 384 ports are configured as switchport mode trunk and encapsulation dot1q.Each port allows 2 VLANs to simulate the 1 PC - 1 IP phone scenario.  So thereare 768 (2 to 769) VLANs and all the corresponding SVIs configured to negotiateIP address through DHCP at the dhcp client side.The dhcprelay switch is configured for DAI, DHCP snooping and IPSG on all theVLANs and ports.  The dhcpclient SVIs are all negotiated and got IP addresses, and the dhcprelaycreated 768 DHCP snooping bindings and the TCAM entries are created.Configure an ACL with 10 ACEs and apply that to 192 interfaces (so that theTCAM entries limit is hit).  The warning messages is not rate-limited and so it's repeated several times.Noticed that the mask limit is hit; the message is rate-limited but not for theentries.Steps to reproduce---------------------1. connect the topology as depicted in the topology diagram and description.2. configure the DAI, DHCP snooping and IPSG on the dhcprelay.3. Wait till all the 768 SVIs on the dhcpclient side is negotiated for the    IP addresses.4. Create an ACL with 10 ACEs and apply that to 144 ports.5. Verify the TCAM limit has reached.6. See the warning message for TCAM limit (entries) is rate limited.Workaround-------------NoneEnvironment variables----------------------n/aShow running-config/ Show mod----------------------------------n/aLog------------TCAM entries------------dhcprelay#sh plat hard acl st ut br                           Entries/Total(%)  Masks/Total(%)                           -----------------  ---------------Input  Acl(PortAndVlan)  7294 / 8112 ( 89)  7294 / 8112 ( 89)Input  Acl(PortOrVlan)   4608 / 8112 ( 56)  4608 / 8112 ( 56)Input  Qos(PortAndVlan)     0 / 8144 (  0)     0 / 8144 (  0)Input  Qos(PortOrVlan)      0 / 8144 (  0)     0 / 8144 (  0)Output Acl(PortAndVlan)     0 / 8112 (  0)     0 / 8112 (  0)Output Acl(PortOrVlan)      0 / 8112 (  0)     0 / 8112 (  0)Output Qos(PortAndVlan)     0 / 8144 (  0)     0 / 8144 (  0)Output Qos(PortOrVlan)      0 / 8144 (  0)     0 / 8144 (  0)L4Ops: used 2 out of 128dhcprelay#conf tEnter configuration commands, one per line.

The COPS-PR MIB is no longer part of the Cisco IOS code as of mid-May 2002. All subsequent images do not support this unsupported feature.  If an issue is reported against the COPS-PR MIB code, it will not be fixed as this code is no longer supported.  Results of this caveat (i.e., a router crash during a mibwalk) can be found  with either V1 or V2.  Conditions: This caveat will resolve all COPS-PR MIB issues as that code will  no longer be present for the Cisco 7200 and Cisco 7500 platform with images  listed below:  12.2(08)YW03  12.2(15)BX  12.2(15)ZN  12.2(15)BZ  12.2(10.07)PI05  12.2(10.07)T  All other platforms will have code removed in phase 2 which will be completed  in Cisco IOS Release 12.3(05.05)T.  Cisco 2600 Routers Fixes are verified in  Cisco IOS Release 12.2(15)T7 and Release 12.2(17).   Workaround: To disable the components from CISCO-COPS-CLIENT-MIB, define an  SNMP view.

CSC.sys,all,telnet,customer-use,1,0,0,0,CSCds33629,Closing Telnet session crashes router..,"The customer has observed that the router crashes sometimeswhen a telnet session is terminated.  I have encluded an email on this topicwith a traceback that was observed while a debug image was loadedto debug another problem.  The same problem has been observed in images withoutspecial debug code.  The special debug code in this image was to debugthe GSR linecards - this crash caused the RP to die.I have asked the customer to configure the router to dump the crashinfo.Currently they get no crashinfo when the problem occurs:From stevmars@cisco.com Fri Sep 22 21:20:09 2000Date: Fri, 22 Sep 2000 12:57:54 -0400 (EDT)From: Steve Marsh &lt;stevmars@cisco.com&gt;To: tshwang &lt;tshwang@cisco.com&gt;Cc: ""Abdulovski, Andy"" &lt;aabdulov@cisco.com&gt;, ""Won, Deok Yeon"" &lt;dywon@cisco.com&gt;,     ""Chapman, Brett"" &lt;bretchap@cisco.com&gt;, ""Ng, James"" &lt;jamng@cisco.com&gt;,     ""Savov, Georgi"" &lt;gsavov@cisco.com&gt;Subject: Re: NGNCR1 GRP Crashed on new debug image again    [ The following text is in the ""X-UNKNOWN"" character set. ]    [ Your display is set for the ""US-ASCII"" character set.  ]    [ Some characters may be displayed incorrectly. ]I took a look at the problem.  The crash is not related to the debug code in the debug image.  The traceback is:Reading /vob/ios/sys/obj-4k-bfrp/gsr-p-mz.symbols/vob/ios/sys/obj-4k-bfrp/gsr-p-mz.symbols read inEnter hex value: 6011E0CC 602C53E0 6019BA68 6019866C 600109C40x6011E0CC:psiset(0x6011e0c4)+0x80x602C53E0:telnetBLOCK(0x602c53bc)+0x240x6019BA68:scheduler(0x6019a97c)+0x10ec0x6019866C:main(0x6019831c)+0x3500x600109C4:_start(0x60010908)+0xbcFrom looking at the assembly code at function psinet the code is dereferencingregister a0.  From the register dump: a0 : 0D0D0D0Dthe pattern 0x0d0d0d0d is the free pool poison pattern - when a memory block isdeallocated it is filled with the pattern 0x0d0d0d0d.  In this case it looks like the data structure that corresponds to the telnet console portdeallocated because the session was closed.  However it looks like therewas telnet data headed for this session at the time.  It looks like thereis a race condition in the code between the telnet output and the closingof the telnet session. Could someone search to see if this is a new bug or not?  There may already bea bug filed.  If not a new one needs to be filed.  For what it is worth,this looks like it should be a rare condition.  I will look thru the codeto see if I see anything obviously wrong in the telnet code.SteveOn Fri, 22 Sep 2000, tshwang wrote:&gt; Steve,&gt; &gt; I'm used to check the bootflash every when we have the crash.&gt; But I never see any info so far.

I think disconnecting lines takes some time toclear lines in use, when script doing unconfig ""no line vty 5,33"", there are some lines still in use and can not be deleted. I noticed whenever script tries to delete the lines in use, router will be crashed.I add some sleep time before doing unconfig in the script, and no crash again.But seems to me router shouldn't crash even if it tries to delete the linesin use.dt3c4_4(config-line)#!Configure more vty line for telnetdt3c4_4(config-line)#line vty 5 33dt3c4_4(config-line)#no transport input allno transport input all                   ^% Invalid input detected at '^' marker.dt3c4_4(config-line)#no line vty 5 33% Can't delete line 135, line in use.dt3c4_4(config)#!dt3c4_4(config)#Unexpected exception, CPU signal 10, PC = 0x6035E3FC-Traceback= 6035E3FC 604F0948 604F9108 60333224 60BBF8F4 603F6E10 603F6DF4$0 : 00000000, AT : 63050000, v0 : 00002015, v1 : 00000015a0 : 0D0D0D0D, a1 : 0000FF00, a2 : 00000000, a3 : 0037EA24t0 : 00000018, t1 : 3401FF01, t2 : 3401E100, t3 : FFFF00FFt4 : 60427110, t5 : 73796E63, t6 : 00000000, t7 : 636F6E6Es0 : 63BB3FB0, s1 : 63BE8E44, s2 : 631E0000, s3 : 00000001s4 : 633D0000, s5 : 622E0000, s6 : 00000003, s7 : 62DC0000t8 : 0D0D0D0D, t9 : 00000000, k0 : 3041F001, k1 : 30410000gp : 6305D060, sp : 63C0E740, s8 : 00000000, ra : 604F0948EPC  : 6035E3FC, ErrorEPC : BFC04560, SREG     : 3401FF03MDLO : 72525BC2, MDHI     : 26F51BBA, BadVaddr : 0D0D0D15Cause 00000010 (Code 0x4): Address Error (load or instruction fetch) exceptionNo fault history 0xFFFFFFFF.

He has rebuild the keys a few times and the behavior is the same but only on these 5 swiches.Reloaded w/ 7.6.7, and the problem happened 2 days after reload.  3 of original 5 are exhibiting the problem again, including newest one that didn't have prob before the reload.All 5 are now running CatOS 7.6(7) per cisco recommendation. Problem appearedon one of the switches within 2 days of code reload (was not a problem with this particular switch when running 7.6(3a) ).Customer took a laptop and plugged in directly into the Switch and the problem continues.1) The main method of connecting to the switches is through Solaris machines used as bastion hosts. The problem appears regardless of which bastion host is used (different physical machines).2) Once the problem happens, it is continuous. Logging off and back on does not clear the condition. So far only a switch reboot seems to clear it. If you attempt to ssh into an affected swich and it fails, you can immediately ssh into an unaffected switch from the same session without a problem.3)This is the results of a trace that was done when the problem first started appearing:Cat6509_switch3&gt; debug: _proc-&gt;tty = 0x852f8794, socket_index = 3debug: version: SSH-1.5-1.2.26debug: Client protocol version 1.5; client software version OpenSSH_3.6.1p1debug: Sent 768 bit public key and 1024 bit host key.debug: Encryption type: 3desdebug: Received session key; encryption turned on.debug: ssh login by user: nlucierdebug: Trying TACACS+ LoginPassword authentication for nlucier accepted.debug: ssh received packettype: 10debug: ssh received packet type: 12debug: ssh148: starting exec shelldebug: Entering interactive session.Here is a synopsis of the 5 switches that the problem has surfaced on:Cat6509_switch1 - Cat 6509 Running 7.6(3a), Switch rebooted on it's own due to TBL exception on 6/11.

CSC.sys,cat3500xl,firmware,customer-use,4,0,0,0,CSCds32999,64 and 66 byte dot1q encapsulated frames are counted as runts,"To recreate, I first had several 7960 IP Phones connected to a 3524-PWR-XLswitch. After the phones register, you see runts steadily incrementing. Thisis caused by some frames the phone is sending out every 5 seconds in an attemptto register with its secondary call manager. Other frames from the boot processalso cause this to happen. I then determined that it was all 64 and 66 bytedot1q encapsulated frames that were causing this to happen. I played backone of these suspect frames and was able to get the runts counter to go upwith just playing back any of the 64 or 66 bytes frames. I then connected the sniffer to a Cat6k and played back the same stream anddid not see any runts being counted. It appears that the switch it removing the dot1q header and then counting the byte size, in which case it ends up being 2 or 4 bytes too short. Fromwhat I can tell, everything still works fine, so I'm assuming the frames arenot being dropped by the switch. After leaving several 7960's connected to the switch overnight, the counters all look about the same like this:evoice-3524-PWR-XL-1a#sh int fas0/4FastEthernet0/4 is up, line protocol is up   Hardware is Fast Ethernet, address is 0030.9439.0a04 (bia 0030.9439.0a04)  MTU 1500 bytes, BW 100000 Kbit, DLY 100 usec,      reliability 255/255, txload 1/255, rxload 1/255  Encapsulation ARPA, loopback not set  Keepalive not set  Auto-duplex (Full), Auto Speed (100), 100BaseTX/FX  ARP type: ARPA, ARP Timeout 04:00:00  Last input 00:00:42, output 00:00:00, output hang never  Last clearing of ""show interface"" counters 13:26:00  Queueing strategy: fifo  Output queue 0/40, 0 drops; input queue 0/75, 0 drops  5 minute input rate 0 bits/sec, 0 packets/sec  5 minute output rate 19000 bits/sec, 53 packets/sec     2419 packets input, 916656 bytes     Received 806 broadcasts, 11327 runts, 0 giants, 0 throttles     11327 input errors, 0 CRC, 0 frame, 0 overrun, 0 ignored     0 watchdog, 806 multicast     0 input packets with dribble condition detected     2653121 packets output, 121727918 bytes, 0 underruns     0 output errors, 0 collisions, 0 interface resets     0 babbles, 0 late collision, 0 deferred     0 lost carrier, 0 no carrier     0 output buffer failures, 0 output buffers swapped out"," Catalyst 2900XL/3500XL Series Switches receiving a 64 or 66 byte 802.1q encapsulated frame on a trunk port will count the frame as a runt, although it will continue to forward the frame.

"," Symptom: A storm of IGMP leave messages are sent between stacks of Cisco Catalyst 3750  switches. May cause reload of 3750.  Condition: This problem might be seen when there are two or more stacks of Cisco Catalyst  3750 switches connected to each other through non-routed (Layer 2) ports, and a  client sends an IGMP leave message.  Workaround: Disable IGMP snooping globally or on a vlan where the IGMP leave flooding is  seen.  More Details: The chances of happening this problem are random. Here are the requirement for  the problem to happen:   1. Leave packet is received on slave switch 2. There is an external mrouter port either on slave or master   After receiving the leave message from slave, the master switch generates a  leave packet to forward on all the mrouter ports. This leave packet is not  correctly generated and hence some of the fields in this packet is un- initialized or garbage. While forwarding such packet on mrouter port, it tries  to access this uninitialized area in the packet structure. This works most of  the time without any crash, but once in a while it may lead to accessing non- existing memory and hence it results in crash. The chances of crash increases  with the rate of incoming leave message. "

CSC.sys,3550,igmp,customer-use,3,0,0,0,CSCeh50547,IGMP snooping does not relay IGMP report to multicast router,"Background:The financial customer, Nikko Cordial Securities Inc. run into a multicastMoH (Music on Hold) problem. The problem is that, when an IP Phone user presses ""Hold"" button of the IP Phone to make a call on hold and let a remote party hear music, and then presses ""Resume"" and ""Hold"" button in a row, the remote party cannot hear the music for 60 seconds at worst.I isolated and minimized the problem, and reproduced it without voice devices such as IP Phone, CallManager at our lab. As a result of that, it turns out that the problem is caused by defect of IGMP snooping process.Problem:When a switch has a multicast receiver which joins a multicast group,and then receives IGMP Leave and Report message for the group from the receiver in a row, it processes the Leave message but not the Report message, which result in OIL being null. This behavior causes multicast receiver to be delayed receiving multicast traffic for 60 seconds at worst, which is default interval of IGMP general query.The problem can be reproduced on Catalyst3550 or Catalyst3750 running 12.1(22)EA4 or 12.2(25)SEB.Topology and Configuration:                              +----------------+                              |   Cisco2621    |                              |                |                              | (Mcast Router) |                              +----------------+                               IGMP .7|Fa0/1                              Querier |                                      |Fa0/2  +--------------+DR          +----------------+            +----------------+  | Catalyst3550 |.9          | Catalyst3548XL |          .3|Cisco3745 Pagent|  |              |------------|                |------------|                |  |(Mcast Router)|Gi0/1  Fa0/1|  (L2 Switch)   |Fa0/3  Fa0/1|   (Receiver)   |  +--------------+            +----------------+            +----------------+                           VLAN 10 (172.16.10.0/24)  - All the interfaces of L2 switch are in vlan 10 (172.16.10.0/24).  - STP and CGMP are disabled on L2 switch.  - Cat3550 has loopback interface (192.168.0.9/32) and advertises it    via OSPF.  - Static RP pointing to the loopback address of Cat3550 is configured    on Cat3550 and Cisco2621.  - Cat3550 Gi0/1 is PIM DR, Cisco2621 Fa0/1 is IGMP Querier.  - Cisco3745 runs Pagent image and works as multicast receiver.How to Reproduce:Step-1. Receiver joins multicast group (239.1.1.1).  Catalyst3550 adds vlan 10 interface to OIL of the (*,G) entry.  // Catalyst3550 - show ip mroute  (*, 239.1.1.1), 00:00:06/00:02:53, RP 192.168.0.9, flags: SJC    Incoming interface: Null, RPF nbr 0.0.0.0    Outgoing interface list:      Vlan10, Forward/Sparse-Dense, 00:00:06/00:02:53Step-2. Receiver leaves the group and rejoins it immediately.  The problem happens at this stage. The last message Catalyst3550   receives is IGMP Report. So it should keep vlan 10 interface in OIL.  But it incorrectly ignores the IGMP Report message and deletes the   interface from OIL.  // Catalyst3550 - show ip mroute  (*, 239.1.1.1), 00:00:19/00:02:51, RP 192.168.0.9, flags: SP    Incoming interface: Null, RPF nbr 0.0.0.0    Outgoing interface list: Null   &lt;=====Step-3. Cisco2621 sends IGMP GQ (General Query).  The problem goes away at this stage. Cat3550 adds vlan 10 interface   to OIL because receiver sends IGMP Report in response to the General   Query and Cat3550 receives the Report.It depends on timing of receipt of messages whether the problem appears.I created Expect script to reproduce the problem constantly and make investigation and verification easier. Please refer to ""Remote-access"" enclosure of this DDTS for more information about reproduction.Problem Details:This is timeline of messages received by Cat3550 in case the problem appears.

The problem happens when receiver rejoins the group during this 2 sec interval. The first Report (3) between two GSQs is sent to rejoin the group. The second Report (5) is sent to reply to GSQ (4).The problem is that the second Report is processed by IGMP snoopingprocess but not relayed to IGMP process on Cat3550. This is why, 2 secafter GSQ (4) is received, GSQ timer expires and vlan 10 interface is deleted from OIL. IGMP snooping process should relay the Report to IGMP process.Attachment:     3550_debug: Debug log captured on Cat3550.

Remote-access: This describes how to access our setup and reproduce the problem with Expect script.  Expect-script: Expect script used to reproduce the problem.","  Symptom:  When a switch has a multicast receiver which joins a multicast group, and then receives IGMP Leave and Report message for the group from the  receiver in a row, it processes the Leave message but not the Report  message, which result in OIL being null. This behavior causes multicast  receiver to be delayed receiving multicast traffic for 60 seconds at  worst.   Condition:  The symptom is seen on Catalyst3550 or Catalyst3750 running 12.1(22)EA4  or 12.2(25)SEB.   Workaround:  The workaround is to disable IGMP Snooping. "

All dot1q ports exhibit this condition where 3550 is connected to Nortel/Alteon Load Balancer.  Symptoms:  Certain packets that are forwarded by the nortel device are padded from varying sizes out to 64 bytes. Such protolcols that emply this are VRRP packets. They appear on the network  as 68byte frames (4 byte header + 64 byte packet). It has been shown that there is one to one correlation between these 68byte packets and the undersize counters incrementing.   Workaround:  Unknown

These can be provided if needed and once I receive them. I will behappy to attempt a re-create, but need more insight as to possible triggers. Anysuggestions from DE are welcome. Please do not let a recreate be a barrier toanalysis and potential fix of the issue. I have asked the customer to set unitup to dump core.Thanks,Jason Wall"," A Catalyst 3550 may reload with one of the following reasons as seen in the show version output:  System returned to ROM by error - Data Access Exception  or  System was restarted by error - Unassigned Exception  Root Cause:  At some time in the past the system ran out of space in the adjacency RAM that is used by the hardware to route packets.  Later, one of the routes whose adjacency would not fit into the adjacency RAM had its adjacency change, and the new adjacency was of a special type (such as a CPU adjacency used to force ARP resolution, or a drop adjacency). When the system tried to check if there was now space for the route's adjacency it misinterpreted the adjacency information for the special adjacency and crashed.  This problem is much more likely to happen with multipath (equal cost or load balanced) routes than with single path routes although it is possible for it to happen with single path routes.  Workarounds: There is no known workaround at this time. Information will be added 	     if a potential workaround is identified. "

CSC.sys,all,tcp,customer-use,3,0,0,0,CSCee54301,Wrong length calculation on TCP SACKOPTION,"Customer encoutered bouncing BGP sessions between two BGP routers. These routers are a pair of routers in a Route Reflector cluster and have multiple clients, however on the session between the two is bouncing. The other sessions to the clients (running different codes) has been stable. This behavior appears to have started when they applied MD5 auth to the BGP sessions. From the logs they see that interval between bouncing every 3 minutes which matches the hold down timer of 180 seconds. Debug ip packet dump on both BGP routers.

It turned out that The problem is caused by tcp_optionbytes adding the SACK length even though we are sending data (not ack segment).The issue is in tcp_optionbytes(). The variable optbytes should never be incremented with the value of the SACKOPTION unless tcp_optionbytes is called by tcp_sendacksegment(), which is the only place the SACKOPTION is inserted in the TCP header.The problem is only detected with MD5 because the string ""0xffffffff ffffffff ffffffff"" is interpreted as part of the data on the receiver and therefore part of the pseudo-header used to create the MD5 hash. On the sender, the same string is considered as part of the options an therefore not included in the MD5 hash. This causes a discrepency that will force the receiver to reject the segment.", Symptoms: Sessions may be reset when corrupted data is received.  Conditions: This symptom is observed on a Cisco router when packet losses  occur and when the ip tcp selective-ackno command is enabled.  Workaround: Disable the ip tcp selective-ackno command.

A rare sequence of crafted IPv4 packets sent directly to the device may cause the input interface to stop processing traffic once the input queue is full. No authentication is required to process the inbound packet. Processing of IPv4 packets is enabled by default. Devices running only IP version 6 (IPv6) are not affected. A workaround is available.  Cisco has made software available, free of charge, to correct the problem.  This advisory is available at http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20030717-blocked.shtml"

(mGRE) tunnels may report the following error  upon receiving an NHRP Receive Resolution Reply packet:    %NHRP-3-PAKREPLY: Receive Resolution Reply packet with error  - insufficient resources(5)   The issue may be related to CSCeb24211, where a Cisco router  running Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP) will lookup a  destination prefix in the NHRP cache when forwarding a packet.  In the process switching path, NHRP will also try to lookup a  cache entry for the real destination prefix, instead of the next-hop IP address for that prefix in its global routing table.  When NHRP performs such a lookup for a host prefix (/32), it  fails to find a match, even if a less specific network cache  entry does exist. This event results in the %NHRP-3-PAKREPLY  message being displayed to the console.    The workaround in this scenario would be to use Cisco Express  Forwarding (CEF).    "

At that time it was observed too that the old NAT entries were waiting to be expired, while the new NAT entries keep on building up so the customer tried to clear the entries with a 'clear ip nat translation forced' but it was not working so the router was reloaded.The next action taken by the customer was to tune on the 'ip nat translationtimeout/tcp/udp/icmp' timer for faster expiring, to keep the number of entrieslow:ip nat translation timeout 120ip nat translation tcp-timeout 120ip nat translation udp-timeout 120ip nat translation icmp-timeout 120From that moment one user could continue going through but they were still reporting slowness because the error was still happening.This is almost all the information I have regarding this problem as unfortunately the session was not logged.Due to this slowness and a lost of telnet connectivity reported after (1 day after) the customer has removed the box from production and a temporary single port ADSL router is used to handle all the traffic. This router originally was connected to 3 ADSL providers.To notice, this customer was running in the past 12.2(8)T with the same NAT config that was working fine. He decided to move the 12.3(4)T in order to use the new feature 'PBR with multiple tracking using SAA/RTR' in a dynamic NAT environment. This feature works fine. You may take a look at the config on the ""show tech"" included within the DDTS.Topic search just points to:CSCuk40898Internally found moderate defect: Duplicate (D)%SYS-2-INTSCHED: may suspend at level 4 in NAT AgerCSCdz51270Externally found moderate defect: Resolved (R)Software forced crash due to NATBut should be fixed and reports the same error on a different NAT function.The DE's that worked at them (Albert Sun &lt;asun@cisco.com&gt; &  Kaushik Biswas kbiswas@cisco.com) have already taken a quick look at this problem and suggest to have a new DDTS opened.","  Symptoms: A router that is configured for PAT may generate the following   error message and traceback while reporting slowness in the network:    %SYS-2-INTSCHED: may_suspend at level 3   -Process= ""IP NAT Ager"", ipl= 3, pid= 118   -Traceback= 80507F58 81310988 80CC14F8 80CD4F80 80CBAD30 80CBAD90 81321684   80CBB048 80504118 805085E0    Conditions: This symptom is observed on a Cisco router configured with PAT and  that has a high number (more than 2500) of NAT entries.

12.2(18)EW1:  -Process= ""SNMP ENGINE"", ipl= 4, pid= 104 -Traceback= 154D08 986540 986740 1D2310 1CC7E0 Aug 17 10:56:55.191: %SYS-2-SHARED: Attempt to return buffer with sharecount 0, ptr= 41C58C0   Workaround: make sure that there is no snmp authentication failure.             For example, if the snmp request is for a community that is not             configured on the switch, then these messages will get triggered.  Impact: There is no known impact of this bug on the normal functioning         of the switch. It is unlikely that the switch will reload because 	of this bug, nor are there likely to be any other side effects.  	Even in case of authentication failure, snmp traps for authentication 	failure are sent to NMS as expected.  Suggestion: If the console is being used, and these messages are becoming 	a nuisance, consider configuring ""no logging console"".  	If even that is not acceptable, then customer may switch to 12.2(20)EW                or 12.2(20)EWA. The above traceback messages do NOT occur in these  	releaes, and authentication failure traps are sent as expected.    "

(See TAC-repro for config of routers used)Below is from customer, outlining his troubleshootingi'm sending you the logs captured during the fault of IP-POPconnectivity by Tunnel GRE, following a brief chronolgy what i did totroubleshoot the problem and to get the logs:16.00 first dump, captured in working field; ""ip cef"" (not distributed)in main config., ""no ip route-cache cef"" & ""fair-queue"" configured ontothe FastEthernet4/0/0 & FastEthernet5/0/0.18.00 configured ""ip cef distributed"", ""ip route-cache cef"" & FIFO queuein the interfaces, got logs.21.30 got information about the services fault.22.30 got logs during fault (""during fault"" file).23.30 configured ""no ip route-cache cef"" in the interfaces.23.45 recived call confirmation the service was on again, got logs(""after fault"" file).24.00 than, tracked in the file ""swapped"": performed clear counters,applied ""ip route-cache cef"" in the interfaces, got logs, applied ""no iproute-cache cef"" in the interfaces, got logs.As you can see into the last file (swapped file), the fall of theservice is always emphasized by a grown of ""output buffers swapped out""in the tunnel interfaces & ""packets input"" onto the Null0 interface...note that during the monitoring period this only happened if the CEF isconfigured onto the physical interface, moreover the sum of the ""outputbuffers swapped out"" onto the tunnel interfaces (257) is approximatelyequal to the incoming packets onto the Null0 (247).this entry relates to the CEF_7507_swapped.zip attachment"," With cef, or dcef configured, a router using gre tunnels may see the  traffic stop flowing in one direction, after a day or two  Workaround:   Option 1:  Do not use cef or dcef, problem doesn't occur with fast  switching    Option 2: shut/no shut the tunnel interface "
