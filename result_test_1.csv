The failure signature will continue on software reset and the Supervisor will fail POST.  However, once power is completely  removed, the supervisor will continue to work as normal.Failures that continue after power is removed are not part of this DDTS.  Hard failures with SRAM are a normal occurance within the expected failure rate of the product.It is unknown is this issue is a software or hardware defect at this time.  Please the TAC-NOTE for additional troubleshooting. "," Symptoms:  Devices connected to a Catalyst 4000 with a WS-X4013 Supervisor II Engine may experience partial or full loss of network connectivity. The loss of connectivity may affect only a portion of the switch ports and may include the uplink ports. These symptoms will be accompanied by rapidly increasing Invalid CRC packets within the switch.  The problem is due to an SRAM component failure which is transient in nature. Please refer to the description of the bug CSCec78085. This SRAM failure has also been seen on Supervisor Engines III (WS-X4014) and IV (WS-X4515). Please see CSCdz57255 for details.  The following indications will be present:  Note: The switch must be running CatOS versions 5.5(10) or higher OR 6.2(3) or higher. Proper identification of this bug is not possible prior to these software versions due to CSCdt80707 or CSCdu48749.  1. At default logging levels, the logging buffer will show a number of the    following messages:  %SYS-4-P2_WARN: 1/Invalid crc, dropped packet, count = xxxx  2. Successive iterations of the command show env 1no for CatOS Releases 5.5(19) and below or show nvramenv 1no for CatOS Releases 6.1(1) and above will show the counter for InvalidPacketBufferCrcs steadily increasing. The increase over several minutes will be in the range of hundreds or thousands. If a small number of InvalidPacketBufferCrcs are seen and the number is not increasing, then that is not an indication of a problem.  The following information should be captured:  show logging buffer -1023no show env 1no or show nvramenv 1no (several iterations) show sprom 1no dump 1no show health 1no show techno  3. After a soft reset of the switch by issuing the resetno command, the Supervisor will fail POST. The POST results should be captured to a text file.  Note: Under certain circumstances POST may abort abruptly, and log the following message:  Insufficient memory pages to satisfy allocation request   Out of memory!  In this situation, the POST results will not be correctly reflected in the  ""sh test 1"" O/P.  This behavior should not be seen on switches running CatOS version 8.2(1)GLX or greater.  4. If the switch is running an image 6.4(7) or 7.6(5) or 8.3(1)GLX or higher capture the following commands: show test switch-memory detailno show test switch-memory affected-entriesno  5. After a hard reset (power off/on) of the switch the Supervisor will pass POST and there will be no further symptoms of the problem. The POST results should be captured to a text file.  All indications must be present in order to conclude that the problem was due to this bug.   Conditions:  This problem has been traced to an SRAM component failure which is transient in nature. The incidence of this failure is extremely rare and is well below the predicted failure rates for this component.  If you believe that you have encountered this bug please open a case with the TAC (Technical Assistance Center) and attach the above captured output to the  TAC case. Boards exhibiting this failure should be replaced using RMA.   Workaround:  Hard reset the switch by powering it off and on.   Software Enhancement:  Newer versions of CatOS software for the Catalyst 4000 family switches now run ongoing diagnostics to detect an SRAM failure. We recommend to use 6.4(8), 7.6(5), 8.3(1)GLX or later released images to use this enhancement.  For further details, please refer to the release-note for the bug CSCec78085.  "

CSC.sys-wish,all,ssh,customer-use,3,0,0,0,CSCeg62710,Need a separate command to enable/disable SSH,"Currently SSH is automatically enabled when the RSA keys are generated.Customers have been confused by the requirement to generate RSA key to start up SSH.In customers' mind, these two are not connected.Another problem is SSL also requires the RSA keypair to be generated.So there is no way to enable SSL without enabling SSH even though theseare two separate features. So it is impossible to disable SSH on platforms where SSL is enabled by default (e.g. Cat3550 and Cat3750 switches).We should provide a CLI command to enable/disable SSH instead of relying onthe presence of the host RSA keys to determine whether SSH should be enabled. In addition, SSH should have the ability to generate its own keys if none exists.Perhaps there is a way to integrate the current and the new behavior so that by default it works like it works now. Then add a ;no ip ssh enable; to allow customers to generate a keypair without SSH being enabled.And ;ip ssh enable; would do both - generate a SSH specific keypair (even if another keypair exists) and enable SSH."," Symptom:  The SSH server in Cisco IOS may become enabled without explicit configuration to have it enabled.  Conditions:  This may happen when IOS automatically generates an RSA keypair to be used by another function, like the HTTPS server.  Workarounds:  In some versions of IOS it is possible to prevent IOS from enabling the SSH server when the default RSA keypair is generated by configuring the SSH server to use a specific, named RSA keypair. For example:  router(config)#ip ssh rsa keypair-name SSHKEY  Please create RSA keys to enable SSH. router(config)#crypto key generate rsa label SSHKEY modulus 1024 The name for the keys will be: SSHKEY  % The key modulus size is 1024 bits % Generating 1024 bit RSA keys, keys will be non-exportable...[OK]  router(config)# *Jan  9 11:30:28.119: %SSH-5-ENABLED: SSH 1.99 has been enabled  Further Information:  This bug is an enhancement request to have an explicit configuration knob to enable the SSH server in IOS.

When this occurs, the 12 10/100 ports with the bad memory condition on that coil will continue to stay connected and experience random connectivity problems.When the line card (coil) gets into this state, only a power-cycle will clear the problem.Proposal:The following options have been discussed:1) error-disable the ports on a particular coil when the condition is detected:-errdisable the 12 ports that are on that coil.-notify (via syslog message) of the bad addresses and that the line card needs to be power-cycled.-then its up to the user to schedule the power-cycle.note: This option would only affect 12 ports when the condition is detected.  With redundant NICs configured the link-down would trigger failover.2) have the nmp automatically power-cycle the line card when the condition is detected.note: This option would affect all 48 ports when the condition is detected.Both options 1 and 2 should be configurable by the user.",  This is an enhancement Bug for handling a packet buffer failure on a single ASIC for  10/100 RJ-45 and RJ-21 line cards:  WS-X6148  WS-X6248 WS-X6348  1) error-disable the ports on a particular ASIC when error condition is detected.  2) Automatically power-cycle the line card when the condition is detected.

CSC.sys,all,ip-rip,customer-use,2,0,0,0,CSCeg16631,CSCee32557 breaks RIP distribute-list w/ VRF interface,"Arcor uses RIPv2 as PE-CE routing protocol on their MPLS-VPN PEs(7500-based, 12.0S). For some RIP CE neighbors they need to filter anannounced default-route, i.e. they accept only the default-route fromsome neighbors and refuse the default-route (and permit everything else)from others. They have been using ;distribute-list <acl> in <interface>;to implement this policy.As this command has never been implemented within the RIP vrfaddress-family but valid within the global context, the parser acceptedit and it was nvgen'ed within the global routing context. The functionalityof the command was still available for vrf routes, and Arcor never botheredasking about it.With the commit of CSCee32557 in 27S3, an additional check was implemented forall RP's using the ;distribute-list; command to prevent any globalcontext distribute-list being configured for a VRF interface. This caused the previously working configuration in 27S2 and earlier to no longer work, the cmd is rejected with the ;The interface is not in the same VRF as theprocess; error message.While I'm aware that distr-list with interface is not supported (seealso CSCea59206 and CSCed84633), this fact was not documented (until recently,see CSCee32741). Arcor urgently needs to go to 27S3 due to other issues, andthey can't workaround the problem.I'm requesting a short-term solution to change the CSCee32557 commit, possiblyby adding a check against pdb->proctype != PROC_RIP to restore the previousconfigurability of this command in the global context."," Symptoms: When you enter the distribute-listno  CmdArginterfacenoCmdArg command in a global RIP routing context and the  interface that is specified in the command is a VRF interface, the command is  rejected with the following error message:  % The interface is not in the same VRF as the process  Because the distribute-listno CmdArginterfacenoCmdArg  command is not implemented in the IPv4 VRF address-family, there is no other way to filter networks received in updates via a VRF interface.

Cisco IOS software releases that are not listed in the ""First Fixed-in  Version"" field at this location are not affected.

Since rshis a closer relative of rlogin than telnet, it seems like rlogin shouldbe regulating it rather than telnet."," Symptom: Unable to execute commands over rsh after enabling ""transport input rlogin"". However, if ""trasnport input telnet"" is configured, the user can succesfully execute commands over rsh.  Conditions: After configuring one or more ""ip rcmd remote-host"" commands and configuring  ""transport input rlogin"" under line configuration, user is unable to execute rsh  commands on an IOS device. The ability to execute rsh commands is, contrary to what one would think, regulated by the ""transport input telnet"" command, not the ""transport input rlogin"" command. In order to enable rsh-style command execution on a Cisco IOS device, both the ""ip rcmd remote-host"" command has to be configured, and ""transport input telnet""  should be configured on the device lines.  This has the side effect of also enabling telnet to the device - while the customer might not want to enable telnet.  Workaround: Configure both ""ip rcmd remote-host"" commands as required, and ""transport input telnet"" under the line configuration. For customers looking to enable only rsh command execution, but not telnet, an access-class can be applied to the appropriate lines in order to permit only rsh but not telnet.

If users reload the system at this point, the VTP database can still be recovered based on the NVRAM VTP storage file. However, if users further modified any VTP domain configuration, e.g. VTP mode, VTP domain name etc. the 0-VLAN VTP runtime database content would be written  to NVRAM. After this point, even though users reload the system, the original VTP VLAN database will be wiped out and the system will come up with the factory default VTP VLAN database, i.e. VTP in server mode with no domain name configured and only VLANs 1,1002-1005 are configured.  The above issue will only happen if the device is in VTP transparent mode and it's seen on cat6k starting from 12.2(17a)SX release and onward.  Workaround: Configure VTP mode in server or client.  "

Note that in this case, behaviour only seen AFTER a communitystring is added to config."," Cisco IOS software releases based on versions 11.x and 12.0 contain    a defect that allows a limited number of SNMP objects to be viewed    and modified without authorization using a undocumented ILMI    community string. Some of the modifiable objects are confined to the    MIB-II system group, such as  ;sysContact ;,  ;sysLocation ;, and     ;sysName ;, that do not affect the device&apos;s normal operation but that    may cause confusion if modified unexpectedly. The remaining objects    are contained in the LAN-EMULATION-CLIENT and PNNI MIBs, and    modification of those objects may affect ATM configuration. An    affected device might be vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack if    it is not protected against unauthorized use of the ILMI community    string.        The vulnerability is only present in certain combinations of IOS    releases on Cisco routers and switches. ILMI is a necessary    component for ATM, and the vulnerability is present in every IOS    release that contains the supporting software for ATM and ILMI    without regard to the actual presence of an ATM interface or the    physical ability of the device to support an ATM connection.        To remove this vulnerability, Cisco is offering free software    upgrades for all affected platforms. The defect is documented in    DDTS record CSCdp11863.        In lieu of a software upgrade, a workaround can be applied to    certain IOS releases by disabling the ILMI community or  ;*ilmi ; view    and applying an access list to prevent unauthorized access to SNMP.    Any affected system, regardless of software release, may be    protected by filtering SNMP traffic at a network perimeter or on    individual devices.

After the ECN supportwas added (CSCeb11974) to IOS, this bug was introduced. ECN bits (CWR, ECE)needs to be written before the MD5 option/digest gets computed. This is obvious since the MD5 digest includes the TCP header and the ECN  bits are part of the TCP header.The curent code writes the ECN bits after the MD5 option is written. This is problematic in situations where MD5 and ECN is turned on, the other side would reject the packet since its digest wouldn't match the one in the packet.The solution is to move the ECN bits writing ahead of MD5 write. PS: the bug is not planned to be fixed in any M/T train (but IOS XE only).", Symptom: When ECN is turned on (ip tcp ecn) and MD5 option is also configured the TCP connection may not come up.

CSC.sys,all,ios-cm,customer-use,3,0,0,0,CSCed40072,FXS port uses H323 instead of MGCP after reload or reset of gateway,See Attachment: BigDescription," Symptom:  A call from an analog phone will fail with reorder tone upon dialing the first digit of a number.  The running configuration of the gateway will list the H.323 dial-peers before the MGCP dial-peers.  Also ""debug voip ccapi inout"" will indicate that the call is hitting the default application which is H.323 instead of hitting the MGCP application.  Condition:  This problem may occur with the following configuration. -An analog phone is connected to an FXS port of an NM-HDA in an IOS gateway -The gateway is configured with ""ccm-manager config"" AND MGCP fallback to H.323  The problem is triggered when one of the following conditions are met. 1. The gateway is reloaded using the command ""reload"" 2. The gateway is reset from the CallManager Administration web page 3. The gateway re-registers with CallManager after losing its network connectivity to CallManagers and falling back to H.323.  During the re-registration process, the gateway will delete the MGCP dial-peers, download the MGCP XML configuration from the CallManager's TFTP server, and  re-add the MGCP dial-peers at the end of the running configuration.  Therefore, when the analog phone goes offhook and dials the first digit on the  FXS port, the call will immediately and incorrectly hit the H.323 dial-peer  (since it is listed before the MGCP dial-peer) and reorder tone will be played.  Workaround:  First disable ""ccm-manager config"" by issuing ""no ccm-manager config"" in global configuration mode.  Then ensure that all of the MGCP dial-peer are listed first in the running configuration.  If they are not, then you will need to manually remove and readd the H.323 dial-peers so that they are listed AFTER the MGCP dial-peers in the  running configuration. "

The successful exploitation enables an adversary to reset any established TCP connection in a much shorter time than was previously discussed publicly. Depending on the application, the connection may get automatically re-established. In other cases, a user will have to repeat the action (for example, open a new Telnet or SSH session). Depending upon the attacked protocol, a successful attack may have additional consequences beyond terminated connection which must be considered. This attack vector is only applicable to the sessions which are terminating on a device (such as a router, switch, or computer) and not to the sessions that are only passing through the device (for example, transit traffic that is being routed by a router). In addition, this attack vector does not directly compromise data integrity or confidentiality.  All Cisco products which contain TCP stack are susceptible to this vulnerability.

CSC.sys,c2800,c2801,customer-use,3,0,0,0,CSCei00807,To Correct FPGA-crypto Engine Buffer Descriptors Checking,"A customer is observing the error message as below when running IPSec/ VPN application under high traffic:%EM_FPGA-1-FPGA_RING_FULL: FPGA   buffer  descripter is fullThere are 2 factors that can contribute to the the FPGA-RING-FULL problem as encountered by the customer.  1) In fpga_fastsend(), the estimation of buffer descriptors required for the crypto operation is incorrect. In the current code, there is an assumption that only 1 buffer descriptor is required for each packet. In fact, different combination of crypto features will lead to different requirements as listed below: encry/decry                             1 BDsingle AUTH                            	3 BDsdouble AUTH                           	6 BDsencry/decry + single AUTH       	3 BDsencry/decry + double AUTH      		6 BDs  2)  In our FPGA-crypto design, there is a total 256 buffer-descriptor available.When running ;encry/decry + double AUTH;, a total of 6 BDs is required for each packet. Considering bi-directional traffic as follows:Tx direction (encryption+authentication):{FE0/0: 64 Rx-ring entries} ------> {FPGA-crypto: 256 BDs} -----> {FE0/1: 128 tx-ring entries} ----> {to peer}Rx direction (decryption+authentication):{FE0/1 (GRE-tunnels): 64 Rx-ring entries} ------> {FPGA-crypto: 256 BDs}If we are under extremely high traffic in both the RX and TX direction; theoretically, we might encounter the shortage of FPGA-crypto BDs since 2x64x6 = 768 entries are required. I have already checked with Jim Grishaw and found that the FPGA-buffer descriptor cannot be further increased beacuse of HW limitation. Therefore, we have no choice and need to drop the packets if FPGA-buffer descriptor is full. Another alternative is to enable Crypto LLQ as suggested by Tracy. But, this solution might further degrade the Crypto throughput performance. "," Symptom: Error Messages of insufficent buffer-descriptors in FPGA-crypto engine happens when running high traffic in IPSec/VPN application.  Conditions: Running ""ESP-3DES + ESP-SHA1 + GRE"" applications under very high  traffic might trigger this problems  Workaround: Reloading the router resolves the issue temporarily.

CSC.sys,cat4000,cat4000-hw,customer-use,2,0,0,0,CSCed61591,Packets above certain size may get dropped by Catalyst 4000,"Due to cosmic radiations, a particular revision of an SRAM from a certain vendorcan experience a single block failure. This failure has been seen in 4 megabitand 8 megabit parts which are used on all of the Catalyst 4000 family switches.These failures are transient in nature and are cleared on a power cycle.Failing bit locations on SRAMs in the failed mode were analyzed and compared tothe internal structure of the sram. All data pointed to cosmic ray radiationcausing the failure, which are known to impact semiconductor devices indifferent ways. Similar effect can be achieved by using ionizing radiations. Thevendor has reproduced theblock failure on a switch in a hospital cancer treatment lab by using acontrolled radiations. After each test the SRAM exhibited a single block failureand recovered on a power cycle, leading the vendor to this conclusion about theroot cause.An SRAM is divided into quadrants and each quadrant is further divided intoblocks. When sub-atomic particles (cosmic rays or ionizing radiations) strike abit in the SRAM in a particular way, the bit  becomes stuck at 1 or 0 and storesexcessive charge. The failure spreads to other bits within the block as a resultof the excessive charge.These particular SRAMs make up the packet buffer memory of the switch, the placewhere a packet is stored when it passes through the switch. The architecture ofthe Catalyst 4000 supervisors is such that each packet written to packet memoryis spread across all of the SRAMs in the system. This increases the probabilityof using the failed part of an SRAM and most packets get corrupted. Thesepackets may leave the switch with a CRC error resulting in packets getting discarded by the link partner.The symptoms of this problem are:- Data loss through the switch- CRC errors on link partnersThe problem has been seen on SUP III & SUP IV IOS based catalyst 4000 products.","  If you see this problem on your switch, the Supervisor should be  replaced. A packet memory diagnostic feature has been enabled to  detect this problem and log appropriate messages.  Software Detection and Workaround  --------------------------------- Newer versions of software for the Catalyst 4000 family switches now run ongoing diagnostics to detect an SRAM failure. The new ongoing diagnostics run read/write tests on packet memory to detect stuck bits. By default, once a memory failure has been detected by the ongoing tests, the system is reset. On boot-up, the affected packet buffers are removed from circulation and hardware switching continues with the unaffected packet buffers. When in such ""normal"" mode, a syslog message is generated every thirty minutes so that the problem gets due attention. As switching continues in ""normal"" mode, it allows you time to schedule downtime for the network and replace the supervisor at a convenient time.  While the system is running, packet buffers cannot be removed from circulation.  Hence, when an SRAM failure is detected, the system is reset so that boot-up tests find the bad block and remove all affected packet buffers from circulation in hardware.  In some network configurations, redundancy is provided by using a redundant link or system and HSRP or similar protocols. In such configurations, a switch with a failed SRAM would need to stay down instead of working in ""normal"" mode, so that network redundancy can be used to switch traffic through an alternate path.  A configuration option ""aggressive"" has been provided to achieve this. With the ""aggressive"" option, the system is reset when an SRAM failure is detected and all ports stay down.  A supervisor that has had an occurence of the SRAM failure should be returned to Cisco. The replacement supervisors do not use this particular version of the SRAM.    CLI ----  	Configuration:         --------------  To direct the action of the switch when it detects a packet memory failure,  use the ""diagnostic monitor action"" command.  Syntax Description:  diagnostic monitor action [conservative | normal | aggressive]  conservative (Optional): The bootup SRAM diagnostics log all failures and remove all affected buffers from the hardware operation. The ongoing SRAM diagnostics will log events, but will take no other action.  normal (Optional): The SRAM diagnostics operate as in conservative mode, except that an ongoing failure resets the supervisor engine. This action allows for the bootup tests to map out the affected memory.  aggressive (Optional) The SRAM diagnostics operate as in normal mode, except that a bootup failure only logs failures and does not allow the supervisor engine to come online. This action allows for either a redundant supervisor engine or network-level redundancy to take over.  Default: normal  Command Mode: Global configuration mode   Usage Guidelines  The ""conservative"" keyword is useful when you do not want the switch to reboot in order to fix the problem. The ""aggressive"" keyword is useful when using redundant supervisor engines, or  when network-level redundancy has been provided.  Examples   This example shows how to configure the switch to initiate an RPR switchover  when an ongoing failure occurs:  Switch# configure terminal Switch (config)# diagnostic monitor action normal  Logged Messages :  When Transient SRAM failure is detected by the software, following message is initially logged :   ""%C4K_SWITCHINGENGINEMAN-2-PACKETMEMORYERROR3: Persistent Errors  in Packet Memory number ""  and later,  ""%C4K_SWITCHINGENGINEMAN-3-PACKETMEMORYERROR2: Multiple Errors in  Packet Memory number ""  In later versions, where the switch is configured in ""normal"" mode to reboot  on detecting such failure, following message is logged after reboot  completes :  ""Packet Memory buffer test detected errors with   of the packet buffers.   Switch operation will continue, with potentially reduced performance.""  In case the switch reboots (in normal mode) with insufficient memory after bootup, it prints the log message :  ""Packet Memory buffer test failed!!!  Insufficient packet buffers are available  to continue booting.""   Related Command:   show diagnostic result module test 2  Purpose: To display the results of the bootup packet memory test, use the show  diagnostic result module test 2 command.

This is causing packet loss on mycustomer network as the application is blackholing traffic from the other end.Problem is reproducable.","  Symptom:  Copper GigabitEthernet SFPs come up during switch power up/boot up, prior to IOS loading and packet forwarding.    In certain network topologies and configurations, traffic could be lost as a result.  For example, network traffic might be lost if the connected device is configured with floating static routes.  Please see the Additional Information section.    Condition:  This problem occurs on ports 2, 6, and 10 on the Cisco Catalyst 3750G-12S only (WS-C3750G-12S-E and WS-C3750G-12S-S).  It does not affect any other interfaces on the Cisco Catalyst 3750G-12S, and does not affect any other products.    There are no problems after Cisco IOS loads.    Workaround:  If using network topologies that are affected by this defect, use a different port if possible.    Additional Information:  CSCeg09013 tracks the defect when using Fiber GigabitEthernet SFPs in the 3750G-12S.  CSCeh70503 tracks the defect when using Copper GigabitEthernet SFPs in the 3750G-12S.

Connected devices operating at Layer 2 will remain in a spanning-tree blocked state (assuming STP/802.1d).  Even if using Rapid STP/802.1w, the connected device will not learn any new MAC addresses, and will not update its L2 forwarding table.  "

As a result, the Cat3750 CPU cannot receive data from  the outside world, although the switch may continue to forward traffic  between its network ports. When this problem occurs, the console of the  Cat3750 switch will hang, and the following message may be seen  repeatedly in the syslog:  %SUPQ-4-CPUHB_RECV_STARVE: Still seeing receive queue stuck after throttling  In addition, since the CPU is no longer receiving control protocol packets  such as STP BPDUs, it may put all ports into forwarding state. This could  create loops in the network, and cause broadcast storms and network outage.  When the CPU queues are locked up, the user will not be able to issue  commands to reload the switch via CLI or SNMP. The only way to recover  is to power cycle the Cat3750 switch which is no longer responding to  user commands.  Workaround: Do NOT configure jumbo frame size  1782 bytes on the Cat3750 switch  running IOS release 12.1(14)EA1 or a lower version. "

May cause reload of 3750.  Condition: This problem might be seen when there are two or more stacks of Cisco Catalyst  3750 switches connected to each other through non-routed (Layer 2) ports, and a  client sends an IGMP leave message.  Workaround: Disable IGMP snooping globally or on a vlan where the IGMP leave flooding is  seen.  More Details: The chances of happening this problem are random. Here are the requirement for  the problem to happen:   1. Leave packet is received on slave switch 2. There is an external mrouter port either on slave or master   After receiving the leave message from slave, the master switch generates a  leave packet to forward on all the mrouter ports. This leave packet is not  correctly generated and hence some of the fields in this packet is un- initialized or garbage. While forwarding such packet on mrouter port, it tries  to access this uninitialized area in the packet structure. This works most of  the time without any crash, but once in a while it may lead to accessing non- existing memory and hence it results in crash.

CSC.sys,all,mem,customer-use,3,0,0,0,CSCej07546,WAY_TOO_MANY_TRIPS needs to be revisited for scale configurations,"This DDTs is created to address the problem of hitting the looplimit of WAY_TOO_MANY_TRIPS in memory code with scale configurationsof 2GB. This is actually spawned from CSCeh45719, in which wecouldnt confirm whether this is a real scaling issue or if therewas any corruption that led to the crash. The loop limit serves the purpose of detecting loops while traversing the memory blocks to make sure that we dont loop around a few blocks for a long time due to corruption.The trip counter (WAY_TOO_MANY_TRIPS) limit currently is 10000000.As the block type is 40bytes, having 10million blocktypesaccount to 400MB of space, which is less one fourth ofthe total memory, and i believe most platforms nearlyallocate 70% of RAM for heap. So this limit of 10000000 may not scale for such higher configurations.There are a few thoughts to handle this:1. One way is to have it configured based on the heap size, as      <heap size carved for the configuration>/<blocktype size> 		(or) 70-80% of the above.   And probably a variable [way_too_many_trips] to be set   with the value above in memory_init() and the macro   WAY_TOO_MANY_TRIPS modified/defined to point to this   variable.2. Or we could probably count the exact number of blocks in the   mempool and use that for ;way too many trips;, but that will   give problems maintaining it amidst the suspends that happen   from processes traversing the block list.3. Or we could make sure that all the pointers (for possible   corruption) are checked properly thereby we can be sure that   there would be no corruption which could lead to a loop, and   hence no need for a counter at all.Diffs for (1) and (2) were tried out and are in the Eng-noteenclosure.", $$IGNORE

Decode of the crash in the log shows it's due to watchdog timer., A watchdog crash may occur on a sup720 due to parity errors in the Layer2 MAC  forwarding table memory. ECC (error correction code) is designed to  automatically correct parity errors as much as possible however a software  defect exists where these parity errors are not handled correctly resulting  in the watchdog crash.   The most common type of parity errors are transient parity errors (ie parity  errors that are *not* the result of bad memory hardware). Transient parity  errors are cleared from the memory after a crash and so another crash would  only occur if new parity errors were experienced. The fix for this bug will  prevent the watchdog crash and allow ECC to automatically correct the parity  errors as it should. In the less likely event that the Layer2 MAC forwarding  table memory is truely bad (bad hardware) a threshold has also been set with  this fix so that recurring parity errors will still result in a crash so that  the bad hardware can be identified and replaced.

When try to ping 76HYB_CON_3 from 76HYB_CON_1, packets getting dropped.At times few packets are      packets, This is happening with all protocols like ipx,xns,vines etc...

In troubleshooting the problem when we connect to a Catalyst 3550, the light is ;Disable; when we 'shut' the interface.  Customer claim other Cisco routers follow this behavior as well.   "," Symptoms: When you enter the shutdownno interface  configuration command on the native Gigabit Ethernet interface of a Cisco NPE-G1 that has the no negotiation autono  command enabled, the Rx LED on the peer interface starts to blink.   Conditions: This symptom is observed on a Cisco 7200 that is connected to a  peer that is configured with a Gigabit Ethernet interface that has Rx and Tx  LEDs and that also has the no negotiation autono  command enabled.   The 7200 NPE-G1 interfaces PHY is emitting signal even when the interace is  admin down.  This keeps the device on the far end potentially in an up/up  state depending on how sensitive that particular hardware PHY is.  Although the Rx light of the affected interface blinks, the interface is in  the up/down state and functions fine.  Workaround: Ensure that both Gigabit Ethernet interfaces have the  negotiation autono command enabled until  negotiation is no longer necessary.   There is no workaround with 'no neg auto' configured if an interface is seeing  signal and is designed to remain down when one side is shut.  If it seeing  signal from the NPE-G1, it may remain in an up/up state.    This issue is also seen on NPE-G2"

CSC.sibu.prods,3750,span-rspan,customer-use,3,0,0,0,CSCeb05555,"RSPAN can leak CDP, DTP, PAgP, and VTP packets onto RSPAN-VLAN","This was discovered during SasquatchCR testing.Lotr1<-->Lotr2Initially, Between Lotr1 and Lotr2  DTP negotiates to trunks (either ISL or Dot1Q).Connect 2 ports on Lotr2 back to back and form a Dot1Q trunk.Then setup a Rspan session on Lotr2 with a source portselected from Dot1Q trunk port.After a while link between Lotr1 to Lotr2 becomes an access link(due to DTP packets were forwarded in Rspan vlan)Also, Lotr1 sees two ports on Lotr2 (internally connected) as theCDP neighbores."," Problem:  This problem exists on Catalyst 3750 switches running 12.1(11)AX software.  When using the Remote SPAN feature (RSPAN), local link control packets such as BPDUs, CDP packets, etc. should not be forwarded to the RSPAN-vlan.  A problem exists on the C3750 in that RSPAN incorrectly spans all packets with a destination mac address of 0100.0CCC.CCCC. This includes packets from, among others, CDP, DTP, PAgP, VTP, and UDLD.  These packets will be tagged with the RSPAN-vlan id, and will then be forwarded on any trunk ports carrying the RSPAN-vlan.  As a result, trunk ports carrying the RSPAN-vlan will see control packets from the RSPAN source ports along with their own local control packets. This can result in confusion and improper operation of these protocols on those trunk ports.  Some possible symptoms of this bug:  - CDP can incorrectly list as a neighbor a switch that was actually a neighbor on the original RSPAN source port.  - DTP may fail to work properly on trunks that are carrying the RSPAN-vlan.  - PAgP may fail to work properly on etherchannels that are carrying the RSPAN-vlan.  - VTP may incorrectly propagate VTP pruning messages on the wrong interface.  For example, a pruning message intended for an RSPAN source port could also appear on the trunk port carrying the RSPAN-vlan.  Workarounds:  1) Prune the RSPAN-vlan from all trunk ports where it is not needed. This can be done, for example, with the command switchport trunk allowed vlan exceptNo CmdArgrspan-vlan-idNoCmdArg.  2) Do not use DTP on trunks carrying the RSPAN-vlan.  Instead, use the commands: switchport trunk encapsulationNo  CmdArgencapsulation-typeNoCmdArg, switchport mode trunkNo, and switchport nonegotiateNo.  3) Do not use PAgP on trunks carrying the RSPAN-vlan.  Instead use the command channel-groupNo  CmdArgchannel-numberNoCmdArg mode onNo to form the etherchannel without negotiation.  4) Be aware that CDP can sometimes give erroneous results.  If necessary, disable CDP, no cdp enableNo, on all interfaces used as RSPAN sources.  5) Be aware that VTP pruning messages may be propagated in error.  6) Be aware that UDLD and any other protocol using destination mac address 0100.0CCC.CCCC may not operate properly on trunk ports carrying the RSPAN-vlan.

Thus 3750 sees fololowing packets from, them:[ip header]->[malformed TCP header with bogus offset and date] [FCS].For some TCP packets data offset (in TCP field) may point beyond the frame (thus tcp data offset if out of the frame).Such frames will be dropped by 3750 (other swtiches like 3550 do not notice this).

Workaround: There is no workaround at this time for the affected devices listed above.  The device fragmenting the packet should be reconfigured, if possible, to not fragment the TCP header.  Additional Information: This problem might occur if the 3750 is forwarding packets that have an encrypted TCP header, or if a packet is fragmented, and the TCP header has been fragmented into two different Ethernet frames.  When using 12.2(25)SED1 or later, these packets that used to be dropped will now be sent in the software forwarding path.  They will not be sent through the hardware forwarding path.  The number of packets that can be sent in the software forwarding path are significantly lower than what is possible in the hardware forwarding path.

Conditions: When VRF is deleted using no ip vrf nameno  command, it will be put in *deleted state AND after all the routes are cleared  in the VRF table, it will be deleted from the router. If it stays in *deleted  state forever, that means for some reason routing protocol has failed to clear  the route in the VRF table. The sh ip route vrf nameno  command will not show anything, but show ip cef vrf nameno  command would show CEF entries, in this case. NOTE: Entries stuck in CEF table is only one of the reasons for the VRF not  getting deleted from the box.  Workaround: The only way to clear the *deleted VRF is by reloading the router.     "
CSC.sys,all,nhrp,customer-use,3,0,0,0,CSCdt23105,NHRP-3-PAKREPLY - insufficient resources reported,See Attachment: BigDescription," A Cisco router running Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP) over  Multipoint GRE (mGRE) tunnels may report the following error  upon receiving an NHRP Receive Resolution Reply packet:    %NHRP-3-PAKREPLY: Receive Resolution Reply packet with error  - insufficient resources(5)   The issue may be related to CSCeb24211, where a Cisco router  running Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP) will lookup a  destination prefix in the NHRP cache when forwarding a packet.  In the process switching path, NHRP will also try to lookup a  cache entry for the real destination prefix, instead of the next-hop IP address for that prefix in its global routing table.  When NHRP performs such a lookup for a host prefix (/32), it  fails to find a match, even if a less specific network cache  entry does exist. This event results in the %NHRP-3-PAKREPLY  message being displayed to the console.    The workaround in this scenario would be to use Cisco Express  Forwarding (CEF).    "

Online Diags however assumes the ASIC is in sync because the global switching mode indicates ""truncated"" (a mix of legacy/bus-only and at least 2 Constellation+ modules is present in the system).

If the inconsistency  happens to affect a single bay's SPA EEPROM C2W device, then it becomes  impossible to determine the type of the SPA inserted in that bay.

Even in case of authentication failure, snmp traps for authentication 	failure are sent to NMS as expected.  Suggestion: If the console is being used, and these messages are becoming 	a nuisance, consider configuring ""no logging console"".

This feature is only supported on the Catalyst 2950  Enhanced Image. To obtain authorization to use this feature, and to  download the cryptographic software files, select ""Download Cisco Catalyst  2950 Strong Cryptographic (3DES) Software"" in the Catalyst 2950 software  download section of CCO.  SSH is a memory-intensive feature, which consequently limits the number of  VLANs, trunk ports, and cluster members that may be configured on the  Catalyst 2950 according to the following restrictions:  *The multiplicative product of the number of trunk ports and VLANs must be  less than or equal to 128 [i.e. (# of trunks)*(# of VLANs) must be less  than or equal to 128].  Thus, if there are 2 trunks on the switch, up to 64  VLANs can be configured (2*64=128).  *If your  Catalyst 2950 switch is also configured as a cluster commander  switch, the cryptographic image can only support up to 8 cluster members in  the cluster.  There is no limitation on the use of other features.  If a switch, which has previously saved configurations exceeding the above restrictions, is loaded with the 2950 Cryptographic software, unpredictable behavior, such as continuous reloads, may occur when system memory is completely running out.  If the following message is observed with the Cryptographic software:  %SYS-2-MALLOCFAIL: Memory allocation of (number_of_bytes) bytes failed ...

These feature specific show commands are neither consistent nor intuitive to use. For an example, if we want to know amount of TCAM used by mac-addresses and how much still left, you can use the ;show mac-address-table count | inc space available; command. For multicast L3 we have ;show platform ip multicast counters; where the ATM info displayed gives the actual information you are looking for. Similarly for l2 multicast, ;show platform ip igmp snoop counter; gives the TCAM used so far through ;atm; column.  We need to provide a global show platform command to display the amount ofTCAM used/left for all features on the whole system. In addition, we need toindicate to the user whether any of the features (e.g. ACL or Unicast Routing)exceed its TCAM allocation and result in packets to be forwarded in software.This new global show platform command should be included as part of the;show tech-support; output so that we can easily determine whether theproblems customers report are due to TCAM full condition.", This is an enhancement request to show actual TCAM usage on the 3750/3760  platforms.

With export-map, the VPNv4 routes could be appended with modified BGP attributes such as extcomm, weight, local-pref etc.(A)The problem is that if the export-map configuration (route-map configuration) is changed, then whether or not the changes become effective automatically is subjected to the PE-CE routing protocol.1) If the PE-CE routing protocol is eBGP (VPNv4 route is learned over an eBGP session from the CE), then the changes made too the export map configuration are not applied to that route even after the BGP scanner runs. BGP scanner has no bearing.2) If the PE-CE routing protocol is EIGRP/OSPF/RIP/ISIS/Static/Connected, then any changes made to the 'export map' configuration are applied during the next BGP scanner run. Hence, the changed are picked up dynamically without any session soft|hard reset.In other words, if the VPNv4 route is redistributed into BGP VRF AF, then the export map changes are dynamically applied.If the VPNv4 routes is directly learned via eBGP, then the export map changes are not applied until the soft|hard reset is done.Please see ;Show-output; enclsoure for further details.(B) The second problem is that if the export-map is removed from the VRF configuration,then the removal of export map doesn't cause any change whatsoever in the BGP table.conf(router#ip vrf v1conf(rotuer-vrf)#no export map setweightImport-map removal works fine though since the import ver# is bumped up.","    Within MPLS VPN framework, curernt export-map implementation doesn't have the mechanism to allow the export-map configuration changes to be applied dynamically using BGP scanner (as we do for the import-map configuration changes) when the  routes are learned over an eBGP session (between PE-CE).   Workaround is to soft|hard reset the PE-CE BGP session every time the export-map configuration is changed as shown below - 	clear ip bgp * vrf vrf soft in  This problem is not present when the routes are learned over an IGP session and redistributed into MP-BGP.

CSC.sys,all,cat4000-ent-l2,customer-use,1,0,0,0,CSCeh21210,MF: DHCP Snooping crash when server send invalid option 82,"DHCP Snooping code which extracts and parse option 82 data doesn't handle the case when misbehaved DHCP server sends an invalid DHCP reply packet. One of the customer is using InfoBlox DNSOne DHCP server which has a potential bug, when replying client's DHCP request with option82 data, it will replace existing option82 with an invalid formated circuit/remote id suboption data. The snooping code always assumes the server reply is in properly TLV formated and didn't validate the suboption in TLV format. The mapped length byte is no longer valid and cause the system to crash when trying to memcpy the suboption data with that length."," None Symptom:  If a DHCP server does not handle option 82 properly and sends a DHCP reply with a malformed option 82 the switch with DHCP snooping enabled could crash. This happens because the switch assumes the option 82 to be properly formed and tries accessing the fields in the packet. Certain malformation could cause the switch to crash.  Conditions:  If there is a DHCP server which don't support option 82, e.g. Microsoft DHCP server,  then the bug won't affect them. If they use DHCP server which support option 82 correctly, e.g. Cisco CNR, then it won't be an issue as well. Only if they use a DHCP server which would send invalid format of option 82 data, then they have a potential to trigger this bug.  This bug for Catalyst6500 could be seen on 12.2(18)SXE releases onwards if DHCP snooping and option 82 is enabled and the customer network has a DHCP server which sends out invalid format of option 82 data.  Workaround:  None other than using a server which supports option 82 correctly e.g. Cisco CNR  "

To see the problem, perform the following steps:1.  Bring up a redundant system in SSO mode, running a crypto image.2.  Create a crypto key on the active with ;crypto key generate rsa;.3.  Verify that the key exists on the active and standby with the    ;show crypto key mypubkey rsa; command.4.  Do a ;write; to write out the private-config.5.  Reload both supervisors with ;redundancy reload shelf;.6.  The key is loaded from the private-config on the active, but is    not synced to the standby.  The ;show crypto key mypubkey rsa;    command will show a key on the active, but no key on the standby.At this point, if a switchover occurs, SSH will be disabled due to thelack of a crypto key.The basic problem here is a result of the fact that the crypto key ischeckpointed from the active to the standby only when it is created fromthe CLI.  Two possible approaches to fixing:1.  We could create an RF client for the crypto code and have it sync    the key from active to standby as part of the bulk dynamic state    sync during bootup.2.  We might be able to find the parser code that handles the different    CLI that is written to/read from the private config and sync the    keys over then as well.I (Kyle) have discussed a bit of the first option with Ken Hiremath, sohe might have some more useful input on that approach."," Symptoms: After an SSO switchover occurs, RSA keys are lost on a Cisco  Catalyst 4500.

Further Problem Description: Although Release 12.3 does not support the Cisco  Catalyst 4500, the fix is integrated in Release 12.3: the fix involves adding  a new redundancy checkpoint client, which entails reserving the new checkpoint  client ID in Release 12.3 to avoid the possibility of future collisions.

That is, brownouts may occur on occasions. The problem is that upon a brownout, the switch shuts down completely and does not come back up. The only way to recover is to either switch the power off/on at the wall, or pull the power out of the back of the switch.Tried recreating this issue in the TAC lab with one of our 3560's. However, I could not reproduce the problem.Obtained one of the 4 or 5 customer's 3560s that exhibited the problem. Using the customer's 3560, I was able to immediately reproduce the problem. The problem was reporduced by very quickly yanking the power out of the 3560 power socket ( only slightly ) and then plugging back in again. The was to basically try and simulate a brownout. The switch would power down and would not come back even though the power cord was fully plugged in and connected.BU has requested a bug be opened and the switch be shipped to them for detailed analysis."," $$IGNORE  A small number of customers have reported a power supply latch-up condition in the Catalyst 3560-24PS that requires user  intervention to recover. We have traced the issue to a condition within  a specific power supply used in the 3560-24PS. Specifically a sub  one second power dip or power outage can cause the power supply to  enter a safety shutdown state requiring a power cycle to resume normal  function. This condition can happen when the 3560-24PS is operating in an  environment where the mains-power is 110 or 220 volts.   All well engineered power supplies have built-in mechanisms to protect  from externally induced mains-power anomalies. Industry standards specify  tolerable ranges for power line anomalies. All power supplies used in the  Catalyst 3560-24PS meet these requirements. In this specific case the power supply is entering a latch-up condition as it cycles too quickly  through the auto ranging function. The latch-up condition is easily cleared by  power cycling the device.   The best solution for this type of issue is to ensure consistent power is available  to the device, as most equipment will fail or reset with this type of power anomaly.  In this case the undesirable consequence is that user intervention will be required  to clear the condition.  Again, this will only happen with power dips of  between 40 msec and 300 msec, for  mains-power of 110 & 220 VAC."

CSC.netbu,gss,platform,customer-use,3,0,0,0,CSCeg62247,Investigate whether GSS should run check disk periodicially,"On rare occasion, the customer will notice that the GSS takes a very longtime to reboot in a normal scenario (i.e. clean reboot).  This is due to the'Maximum Mount Count' being hit on one of the partitions (usually STATE)and therefore the kernel forces a Check Disk.  (examine with 'tune2fs -l /dev/hda11')The STATE partition is the main reason for concern because it is very large andtakes a really long time to check.  It appears that the maximum mount count is set to 25 in the default install of GSS software.  The question is why?Is there any reason it should be set at all?  It appears on modern versionsof RedHat (anything past 7.2), the Maximum Mount count is set to -1, whichmeans that no Check Disk will be performed periodically when the partitionis mounted.  The partition will still be checked if it was not unmountedcleanly (hard power cycle).I would suggest we investigate this and see if there is any reason at allto peform periodic check disks in non-error scenarios. My impression is that is unnecessary, but that could be because modernRedHat distros use journalling filesystems by default.  The 4480 and 4490do not (and probably never will) whereas the 4491 does use journalling.It seems like a bad thing if the GSS takes a very long time to reboot undernormal circumstances.  Even if this only occurs once every 25 reboots, itis too much."," Symptom: With this bug fix the following message is seen on console only on the release older that GSS410  EXT3-fs warning: maximal mount count reached, running e2fsck is recommended  Release GSS410 should not see this message.
