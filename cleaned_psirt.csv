CSC.datacenter,ucs-blade-server,bmc,customer-use,3,0,0,CSCuc26360,KVM avct_server : Avocent server certificate expired since 2010," Symptom: The KVM Java client may pop up an error/warning message stating that the KVM certificate to the blade has expired.   Conditions: When opening a KVM session to a UCS blade server, the KVM java client will announce that the certificate has either expired and/or is untrusted.   Workaround: The proposed workaround is to trust the certificate until Cisco releases a new firmware with update certificates. The Java client will state that the  certificate is untrusted and allow you to make the decision on trust. You can trust the certificate. If you do not, the KVM session will not establish.

CSC.datacenter,nexus-3000,cli,customer-use,3,0,0,CSCul23419,Cisco NX-OS Arbitrary File Read Vulnerability," Summary Cisco NX-OS software contains a directory traversal vulnerability within the command line interface that could allow a local, authenticated attacker to disclose the contents of arbitrary files on the affected device.  An attacker could leverage the NX-OS ''copy'' command to duplicate the contents of arbitrary files on the device to a user writable area of the filesystem.  As the new file will be owned by the authenticated user, the attacker will be able to view the contents.  This vulnerability affects the following platforms which are based on Cisco NX-OS: Cisco Nexus 7000 Cisco MDS 9000 Cisco Nexus 6000 Cisco Nexus 5500 Cisco Nexus 5000 Cisco Nexus 4000 Cisco Nexus 3500 Cisco Nexus 3000 Cisco Nexus 1000V Cisco Connected Grid Router 1000 Series Cisco Unified Computing System Fabric Interconnect 6200 Cisco Unified Computing System Fabric Interconnect 6100  Conditions Device is running an affected version of Cisco NX-OS software; An authenticated user with the privileges to run the copy command.  Further Problem Description: This issue was discovered during internal testing by Cisco.  PSIRT Evaluation:  The Cisco PSIRT has assigned this bug the following CVSS version 2 score.

If you have access to the TALOS bug system, you can review the data here:   https://bugzilla.vrt.sourcefire.com/show_bug.cgi?id=328305   Below is the final summary from the bug:   ?I'm happy to inform you that coverage for the exfiltration techniques that can be covered in this paper has had coverage committed, or exists already.   In addition to the DNS tunneling indicators in Comment #10, we've also got the following rules to detect different types of data exfiltration:   For the SSH tunneling, since its encrypted, we can't detect the traffic, however, for ssh on non-standard ports, we have SID 13586.   For ICMP tunneling, we have a rule to detect ptunnel, SID 21853. Additionally, we have SIDS 384 and 29456 for unusual ICMP traffic.   Like stated in Comment # 9, we cannot provide detection for the NC64 proof of concept tool. Its designed to work over multiple tcp/udp connections and evades the session requirement of snort.   The Tun64 tool does ipv6 in ipv4 by packing an ipv6 connection into an ipv4 packet, and setting the ipv4 protocol to 0x41, which is the ipv6 protocol indicator. We have a rule to detect this, SID 8446. The snort_decoder can also detect these kinds of sessions when encapsulated inside of a GRE packet, which is a feature the tool also provides. However, we can't directly detect TUN64, as all of the data it contains is in plain text.   Finally, for the HTTPtunnel tool, SID 43565 was just committed to detect this proxy tool, and will be available in an upcoming release.   Here's the full list of SIDS we offer to detect data exfiltration using these techniques:   13586 21853 384 29456 8446 43565 21355 30881 19187 27046 ?   The above references comment 9 and comment 10:   Comment 9: ?I took a look at the nc64 tool.   NC64 works by taking the data meant for covert exfiltration and sending it across multiple randomly chosen ipv4/ipv6 connections. This bypasses normal detection because there are multiple sessions.   Unfortunately, because there are multiple random ipv4/ipv6 connections, we cannot write plain-text rule for the nc64 tool.   I will continue investigating the tun64 tool, as well as some of the ipv6 exfiltration mechanisms it uses. ?   Comment 10: ?I've been working on this as I can, we have coverage for a lot of the tools inside the bug, here are a few of the sids and the tools that are covered by them:   dnscat: 30881 Iodine dns tunnel: 27046   Generic dns rules for possible tunneling attempts: 21355 30881 19187     I'm still working on a few of the other tunneling mechanisms like httptunnel and tun64, and once I have some more information regarding those, I will update this bug.?

CSC.datacenter,n9k-standalone-sw,python,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCve97102,Cisco NX-OS Python Parser Escape Vulnerability," Symptom: A vulnerability in the Python scripting subsystem of Cisco NX-OS System Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to escape the python parser and gain unauthorized access to the underlying operating system of the device.  The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of user supplied parameters passed to certain Python functions within the scripting sandbox of the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to escape the scripting sandbox and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the authenticated user.  This advisory is available at the following link: https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171018-ppe  Conditions: To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have local access and be authenticated to the targeted device with administrative or python execution privileges. These requirements could limit the possibility of a successful exploit.  Workaround: There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  A mitigation for this vulnerability is to ensure administrators have restricted python sandbox access to only highly trusted users.

Further Problem Description: The Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol allows for secure communication between a client and a server. The client  usually authenticates the server using an algorithm like RSA or DSS. Some SSL ciphers allow SSL communication  without authentication. Most common Web browsers like Microsoft Internet Explorer, Netscape and Mozilla do not use  anonymous authentication ciphers by default. A vulnerability exists in SSL communications when clients are allowed  to connect using no authentication algorithm. SSL client-server communication may use several different types of  authentication: RSA, Diffie-Hellman, DSS or none. When 'none' is used, the communications are vulnerable to a  man-in-the-middle attack.''  The following ciphers are reported which require no authentication:  AECDH-RC4-SHA AECDH-DES-CBC3-SHA AECDH-AES128-SHA AECDH-AES256-SHA  PSIRT Evaluation: The Cisco PSIRT has assigned this bug the following CVSS version 2 score.

The vulnerability is due to a potential race condition while regenerating the affected device's cryptographic certificate and keys during an upgrade to image 7.2 or later from an image prior to 7.2. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by negotiating a number of HTTPS connections with the management interface while key regeneration is in process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to create a DoS condition. The condition will persist until the device has been restarted.  The vulnerability can be triggered only by SSL/TLS traffic directed to the TCP port and IP address of the management interface associated with the web server. The default TCP port is 443. Packets transiting an affected device through the sensing interfaces cannot be used to trigger this vulnerability.  Conditions: Device Upgrade from pre-7.2 to 7.2 or later.  Workaround: Reboot, or to ensure a successful workaround, disconnect the management interface first.

This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to take full control of the OSPF Autonomous System (AS) domain routing table, allowing the attacker to intercept or black-hole traffic.  The attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting crafted OSPF packets. Successful exploitation could cause the targeted router to flush its routing table and propagate the crafted OSPF LSA type 1 update throughout the OSPF AS domain.  To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must accurately determine certain parameters within the LSA database on the target router. This vulnerability can only be triggered by sending crafted unicast or multicast OSPF LSA type 1 packets. No other LSA type packets can trigger this vulnerability.  OSPFv3 is not affected by this vulnerability. Fabric Shortest Path First (FSPF) protocol is not affected by this vulnerability.  Workarounds that address this vulnerability are available.

These modules will require a BIOS update to resolve the vulnerability.  A workaround is noted below.  Conditions: Cisco UCS M4 Series Servers with a UCS-TPM1-002 or UCSX-TPM2-002 module installed and utilizing an affected BIOS version.  Cisco UCS M5 Series Servers with a UCS-TPM1-002 or UCSX-TPM2-002 module installed and utilizing an affected BIOS version.  Workaround: It is possible to work-around this TPM issue by generating an RSA key pair externally to the TPM using a trusted generation scheme, and then importing the private key into the TPM using standard TPM 2.0 interfaces and commands. Please also remember to Clear the TPM of existing RSA keys upon either firmware update or utilization of the above work-around as that will ensure that weak keys are no longer employed.

CSC.ena,ncs6k,sse-ucode,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCuu31827,packet corruption w/PHP when L2 trailer eixists in packet," Symptoms: Packets dropped on ultimate hop pop (UHP) node on ingress with ''IPV4 checksum errors'',  where NCS6k is acting as PHP node and running 5.2.3 version image.  Packet captures on UHP ingress show corrupted UDP header.  Conditions: Problem is seen in an inter-op scenario when all the the below conditions meet:  - incoming MPLS packet is trailed with extra bytes on an NCS6k node   - that is running 5.2.3 or a newer version image and   - acting as PHP node for the stream. These specific packets are not handled gracefully on NCS6k and get corrupted while processing.    First condition is a very specific case and should not exist for ServiceProvider network.   Any other data/control traffic streams, flowing through NCS6k at the same time which don't  have trailing bytes...are not impacted.  Problem is not seen for an IP only network.  Workaround: Configure explicit-null on UHP node.  Further Problem Description: When MPLS packets with trailing bytes reached NCS6k, it was not handled gracefully on 5.2.3  release which supports NHID based forwarding. In earlier release that didn't have NHID based  forwarding , this case is handled gracefully.   Problem is seen when all the below conditions meet:     a.	incoming MPLS packet is trailed with extra bytes on an NCS6k Ingress linecard     b. that is running 5.2.3 or a newer version image and      c.	acting as PHP node for the stream.  Problem Impact:     a. These specific packets are not handled gracefully on NCS6k and get corrupted while processing          and were dropped on the next node (UHP node).     b. All other data/control streams that didn't have trailing bytes, were flowing fine.   Condition a. is not likely for a production ServiceProvide network. In this case we hit upon  the issue as upstream 7600 was adding extra trailing bytes to the packet.   Here are some workarounds which were tried and found to be working:     a.	Replaced 7600 node (doing MPLS encapsulation) with ASR9K.      b.	Add static route on 7600 such that outgoing packet from 7600 node is unlabeled.      c. Configure explicit null on UHP node such that NCS just does label swapping and will not do PHP processing.     d.	When image was downgraded to 5.0.1 issue was not seen as it didn't have NHID forwarding.  PSIRT Evaluation: The Cisco PSIRT has assigned this bug the following CVSS version 2 score.

CSC.datacenter,c6k-ace,cp_management,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCug78957,Cisco ACE20 Log Retention Denial of Service Vulnerability,"   Symptom:  A vulnerability in SSL logging daemon on Cisco ACE could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause partial DOS condition on the affected  device. The vulnerability is due to Cisco ACE not rotating logs from XML SSL sessions, causing a hard drive to run out of free space. An attacker could exploit this  vulnerability by sending a large amount of SSL connections to the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust free space on the  hard drive, causing operations such as configuration and writing configurations on the disk to fail with the following error: ''write error: No space left on device'' Additional errors can be seen on the Cisco ACE console.  This described possible attack case scenario is only if ACE management XML access is allowed to everyone, which is usually not a case, since usually is restricted only to the management stations via management ACL. Otherwise issue may still occur after long time of use of the XML interface.    Conditions:  - Running A2(3.6) or later and heavily using the HTTPS XML management interface.   Workaround:  Contact TAC that can apply a workaround on your module.   PSIRT Evaluation: The Cisco PSIRT has assigned this bug the following CVSS version 2 score.

CSC.datacenter,nexus-1000v,svs-security,customer-use,3,0,0,CSCux54898,"Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting Denial of Service Vulnerability"," Symptom: A vulnerability in the authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) implementation of Cisco Firepower Extensible Operating System (FXOS) and NX-OS System Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload.  The vulnerability occurs because AAA processes prevent the NX-OS System Manager from receiving keepalive messages when an affected device receives a high rate of login attempts, such as in a brute-force login attack. System memory can run low on the FXOS devices under the same conditions, which could cause the AAA process to unexpectedly restart or cause the device to reload.  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing a brute-force login attack against a device that is configured with AAA security services. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.

CSC.sys,csr1000v,esg-mibs,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCve78027,Polaris crash in ADSL SNMP code," Symptom: The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subsystem of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software contains multiple vulnerabilities that could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to remotely execute code on an affected system or cause an affected system to reload. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected system via IPv4 or IPv6. Only traffic directed to an affected system can be used to exploit these vulnerabilities.  The vulnerabilities are due to a buffer overflow condition in the SNMP subsystem of the affected software. The vulnerabilities affect all versions of SNMP Versions 1, 2c, and 3. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 2c or earlier, the attacker must know the SNMP read-only community string for the affected system. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 3, the attacker must have user credentials for the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the affected system or cause the affected system to reload.  Cisco will release software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

If VoIP applications are in use but the supplicants support CCKM (for example, Cisco Wireless Phones) - you can disable 11r support and reconfigure the clients to use CCKM (Cisco Centralized Key Management), which should provide a similar roaming experience.  NOTE: Disabling 11r support may have negative performance and availability impact on the network. Customers should verify that disabling 11r would not negatively impact their environment before performing such configuration change on their infrastructure devices.

CSC.sys,all,ipsec-core,customer-use,1,0,0,CSCty54187,ASR1K:  ASR fails to encrypt with VRF-aware crypto map," Symptom: ASR receives packets via LAN interface, but fails to encrypt them.  This only occurs when the ASR  is configured with a vrf-aware crypto map.  Conditions: -ASR must have vrf-aware crypto map. -Interface on which the packets are received (i.e. LAN interface) belongs to global VRF. -Interface on which the vrf-aware crypto map exists belongs to custom fVRF.  Workaround: There are two workarounds depending on the use case.  WORKAROUND 1 - EasyVPN configurations  For EasyVPN configurations (Remote access client or hardware branches) it is recommended to modify the head-end configuration and use Enhanced Easy VPN by simply adding a Virtual-Template and declaring this Virtual-Template under the ISAKMP profile.  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/routers/access/cisco_router_and_security_device_manager/25/software/user/guide/EEZVPN.html  Enhanced Easy VPN (FlexVPN for IKEv2) is the recommended configuration and will provide an actual FIX to the problem (not just a workaround).  The CLIENT (branch) configuration DO NOT need to be modified.  WORKAROUND 2 - dynamic crypto maps  Multi-SA dVTI should provide an ideal fix for the situation.  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios-xml/ios/sec_conn_vpnips/configuration/15-2mt/sec-ipsec-virt-tunnl.html#GUID-D8A6CA90-5872-4FBC-A803-536E04D4739A  WORKAROUND 3 - static crypto maps  The following work-around will allow the ASR to receive the traffic from the LAN interface, and pass over an existing IPSec SA.  Note:  The IPSec SA must already be formed.  1. Move the ASR to version asr1000rp1-adventerprisek9.03.04.04.S.151-3.S4  2. Configure a Loopback as a member of the iVRF 3. Using an IP SLA, initiate periodic traffic between the loopback and the remote protected network.   This will bring up the IPSec SA, and will keep it up. 4. After the above 3 steps are completed, the ASR will match the LAN-side packets it receives  against the crypto ACL  -The above work-around will 'NOT' work if the IPSec SA is not complete prior to the  LAN traffic arriving to the ASR.

CSC.general,meetingserver,security,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCvf51127,Cisco Meeting Server TURN Server Unauthorized Access and Information Disclosure Vulnerability," Symptom: A vulnerability in the Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN) server included with Cisco Meeting Server (CMS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthenticated or unauthorized access to components of or sensitive information in an affected system.  The vulnerability is due to an incorrect default configuration of the TURN server, which could expose internal interfaces and ports on the external interface of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a TURN server to perform an unauthorized connection to a Call Bridge, a Web Bridge, or a database cluster in an affected system, depending on the deployment model and CMS services in use. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthenticated access to a Call Bridge or database cluster in an affected system or gain unauthorized access to sensitive meeting information in an affected system. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid credentials for the TURN server of the affected system.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Additional information on Cisco's security vulnerability policy can be found at the following URL: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_policy.html  ","While investigating TURN vulnerabilities in SERVER-6541, I found that our TURN server's default configuration allows forwarding traffic from an external interface to its loopback interface. This essentially means that a CMS running a collocated TURN server exposes all its internal ports. This includes TCP traffic if TLS has been configured in the TURN server.Access to internal ports allows bypassing the HTTP proxy server which performs authentication. This allows unauthenticated access to the webadmin server.A typical setup is to run a TURN and a webbridge server in a DMZ. An attacker could connect a callbridge under their control to a victim's webbridge (all the attacker needs is the victim's callbridge public certificate and TURN credentials). The victim's webbridge will then send conference lookup messages (containing both ID and passcode entered by users) to both the victim's and attacker's callbridges.Other attacks may be possible by accessing other internal ports (e.g media interface)"," This is a serious issue, which may be made public shortly. A public response  or advisory will be released at that time.   PSIRT-owner: wgarvin date: 1/06/2004 "

Analysis from development team: All shipping versions of ACS are vulnerable CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169,  CVE-2014-7186, CVE-2014-7187 , CVE-2014-6277 and CVE-2014-6278 (AKA ShellShock bug). ACS patch will be made available for all supported versions of ACS in a timely manner.  That said, the exposure of this bug in ACS is very limited.  The shellshock vulnerability allows an SSH AUTHENTICATED user run a generic Linux command.   The key word being 'AUTHENTICATED'.  Hence if an attacker does not have the username and password of an ACS CLI user, they will not  be able to exploit this vulnerability on ACS.   If the user DOES have credentials, and would like to exploit the shellshock, that CLI user would be able to run generic Linux commands on the ACS Server that would normally not be able to run (Because the ACS CLI does not expose generic Linux commands).  However those Linux commands will run as the logged in CLI user account, not as the Linux root user.  Hence, this limits exposure of the vulnerability in ACS.  An example of an exploit using shellshock in ACS would be to view Linux system files they would normally not be able to view.   The workaround to remove the vulnerability would be to disable the SSH daemon via the following CLI, then reload the ACS server to ensure all  SSH sessions have been terminated.  The following CLI demonstrates how to to disable SSH service and reload the node:  ---snip acs1/admin# configure terminal acs1/admin(config)# no service sshd enable  acs1/admin(config)# end acs1/admin# reload Save the current ADE-OS running configuration?

CSC.security,anyconnect,nam,customer-use,3,0,0,CSCuu12962,NAM change password functionality does not verify old password," $$IGNORE-PSIRT  Symptom: NAM will authenticate using EAP to an authentication server.  If it is using Mschapv2 or GTC, the server will verify the users credentials, and if they are valid and  expired, the server will send a reply indicating the password was valid but expired.  If the credentials were invalid, the server would simply fail the EAP  authentication.  In the case that the creds are expired, NAM will receive a message indicating that the password is expired and will prompt the user with a dialog  box that contains one box for current password and 2 boxes for the new password.  At this point if a user enters an invalid password and new passwords that  match and meet password change criteria the password will be changed.  Conditions: NAM provides 802.1x authentication and can be configured multiple ways.  If NAM is configured for what is referred to as prelogon, that means the  authentication over 802.1x occurs as the user is logging in to the Windows machine.  NAM under that scenario must have single signon (SSO) configured to  work.  Workaround: None.  Further Problem Description: None.

CSC.datacenter,n7k-infra,aaa,customer-use,4,0,0,CSCuq58760,"Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting Denial of Service Vulnerability"," Symptom: A vulnerability in the authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) implementation of Cisco Firepower Extensible Operating System (FXOS) and NX-OS System Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload.  The vulnerability occurs because AAA processes prevent the NX-OS System Manager from receiving keepalive messages when an affected device receives a high rate of login attempts, such as in a brute-force login attack. System memory can run low on the FXOS devices under the same conditions, which could cause the AAA process to unexpectedly restart or cause the device to reload.  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing a brute-force login attack against a device that is configured with AAA security services. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

The rpc.statd server is an RPC server that implements the Network Status and Monitor RPC protocol. It's a component of the Network File System (NFS) architecture. rpc.statd contains a format string vulnerability when calling the syslog() function. This vulnerability allows remote users to execute code as root. The logging code in rpc.statd uses the syslog() function to pass user-supplied data as the format string. A malicious user can construct a format string that injects executable code into the process address space and overwrites a function's return address, forcing the program to execute the code. rpc.statd requires root privileges for opening it's network socket, but fails to drop these privileges later on. Therefore, code injected by the malicious user will execute with root privileges. Debian, Red Hat and Connectiva have all released advisories on this matter. Presumably, any Linux distribution that runs the statd process is vulnerable, unless already patched for the problem. IMPACT: If successfully exploited, unauthorized users can execute remote commands as root. "," PSIRT-owner: psirt@cisco.com           This issue has been evaluated and driven to closure by PSIRT.

CSC.voice,meetingplace,platform,customer-use,3,0,0,CSCur38341,NTP Attacks Using CVE-2013-5211," Symptom: A vulnerability in Network Time Protocol (NTP) package of Cisco Finesse Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition on an affected device.  The vulnerability is due to processing of MODE_PRIVATE (Mode 7) NTP control messages which have a large amplification vector. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending Mode 7 control requests to NTP servers and observing responses amplified up to 5500 times in size. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition where the affected NTP server is forced to process and respond with large response data.  Conditions: All versions of ntpd prior to 4.2.7 are vulnerable by default.  Workaround: The simplest recommended course of action is to upgrade all versions of ntpd that are publically accessible to at least 4.2.7. However, in cases where it is not possible to upgrade the version of the service, it is possible to disable the monitor functionality in earlier versions of the software.  To disable ?monlist? functionality on a public-facing NTP server that cannot be updated to 4.2.7, add the ?noquery? directive to the ?restrict default? line in the system's ntp.conf, as shown below:  restrict default kod nomodify notrap nopeer noquery restrict -6 default kod nomodify notrap nopeer noquery disable monitor  After the change is done, restart ntpd service.

Additional details about the vulnerability described here can be found at: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityNotice/CVE-2013-5211  Additional information on Cisco's security vulnerability policy can be found at the following URL: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_policy.html   ","The NTP service supports a monitoring service that allows administrators to query the server for traffic counts of connected clients. This information is provided via the ?monlist? command. The basic attack technique consists of an attacker sending a ;get monlist; request to a vulnerable NTP server, with the source address spoofed to be the victim's address.Impact:The attack relies on the exploitation of the ;monlist; feature of NTP, as described in CVE-2013-5211, which is enabled by default on older NTP-capable devices. This command causes a list of the last 600 IP addresses which connected to the NTP server to be sent to the victim. Due to the spoofed source address, when the NTP server sends the response it is sent instead to the victim. Because the size of the response is typically considerably larger than the request, the attacker is able to amplify the volume of traffic directed at the victim. Additionally, because the responses are legitimate data coming from valid servers, it is especially difficult to block these types of attacks. The solution is to disable ?monlist? within the NTP server or to upgrade to the latest version of NTP (4.2.7) which disables the ;monlist; functionality."," PSIRT-owner: psirt@cisco.com           This issue has been evaluated and driven to closure by PSIRT.

The vulnerability is due to improper usage and handling of the pickle Python module by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted pickle file to a targeted device. A successful exploit could be used to conduct further attacks.  Conditions: Device configured with default configuration.  Workaround: None.  Further Problem Description: Exploit requires authenticated access to WSA in order to be carried out.   PSIRT Evaluation: The Cisco PSIRT has assigned this bug the following CVSS version 2 score.

Additional information on Cisco's security vulnerability policy can be found at the following URL: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_policy.html ","The WSA uses a pickle file to check the status of the support remote access tunnel.  This file is called TUNNEL_INFO and is stored in the admin user's home directory.Pickle and cPickle introduce the ability to execute arbitrary Python code.  A malicious pickle file will cause the WSA to run Python code in the context of the root user.  Given the ability to write to the admin user's folder (for example, simply breaking out of the CLI environment), a user could escalate to root privileges on the WSA.If the user has invoked the 'techsupport' command, the attack may take onlyseconds.  Otherwise, it will require the user to run the 'techsupport' command.After the attack has occurred, it will be difficult for the customer to recover.The only way for a normal user to replace the 'TUNNEL_INFO' file is to use the'techsupport' command.  Unfortunately, the 'techsupport' command crashes whileloading the TUNNEL_INFO file (with a ;TypeError: 'int' object is unscriptable;).Since customers don't have shell access, the WSA will continually run the codein the malicious pickle file.Steps to reproduce:1) Logged in as admin, from a standard csh shell on a stock WSA, changedirectory to /data/home/admin.2) Create the TUNNEL_INFO pickle file that will create an empty file in alocation where only the root user has privileges:cat >TUNNEL_INFO <<EOLcossystem(S'touch /data/vulnerable'tR.EOL3) Check the /tmp folder for the 'vulnerable' file.  If it's not there, just run the 'techsupport' command.The solution to this issue is to remove the dependence on Pickling, as the pickle module is inherently vulnerable to code execution.

The vulnerability is triggered by an H.264 frame that has an invalid picture parameter set (PPS) value. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a  malformed H.264 frame to the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition because the media process could  restart. The media session should be re-established within a few seconds, during which there could be a brief interruption in service.  There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Secondly, you can't update the PPS for a given ID mid-frame ;Any picture parameter set NAL unit containing the value of pic_parameter_set_id for the active picture parameter set RBSP for a coded picture shall have the same content as that of the active picture parameter set RBSP for the coded picture unless it follows the last VCL NAL unit of the coded picture and precedes the first VCL NAL unit of another coded picture.;  Our decoders enforce the second of these but not the first.Our GPU decoder isn't affected - but X-series still isn't immune because it uses the affected software H264 parser.Issue exposed by mediatest / mf_stress and also noticed by Bedfont.

Note: Engineering Special Releases that are installed as COP files, as opposed to the standard upgrade method, do not remediate this vulnerability.  An attacker who can access an affected device over SFTP while it is in a vulnerable state could gain root access to the device. This access could allow the attacker to compromise the affected system completely.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

Additional information on Cisco's security vulnerability policy can be found at the following URL: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_policy.html","Finesse Notification Service (OpenFire) creates a federated presence listener for the 2 nodes of the cluster to check the presence of each other. By default, a random password based on the VOS platform's security password is created during install and and replicated between the two nodes, and used as a shared secret for this user. However, if replication is broken between the two nodes, there is a hardcoded password that is used as the default to prevent the system from going out-of-service. The code is written in such a way that the default hard-coded password can always be used by the federated presence listener to connect to OpenFire and subscribe to events. The port for event subscription (5222) is open on the firewall for external clients to subscribe to OpenFire events. Therefore, this constitutes a remote access vulnerability.This vulnerability exists only in the 11.5 and 11.6 versions.

The vulnerability is due to the incorrect detection of an SMB2 file when the detection is based on the length of the file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by  sending a crafted SMB2 transfer request through the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass filters that are configured to block SMB2  traffic.  Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.

The file is small and fits within a single read response. It seems that if the create request and read request are sent together, and then the read response and the create response are being sent together, then the file is not blocked. If the create request/response happens first, and then the read request/response, it is blocked successfully. Also, if the file is larger so that it needs two read responses, then it works fine, and the second read response is blocked, even if the create and read request were originally sent together.Attached to the bug is a pcap where the file is transferred and not blocked - it was taken on the client and the entire contents of the file are present. The client was Windows 10 and the server was Windows 2012.Steps to reproduce:1) Create AC policy with file policy to block exe file type w/ reset2) Replay pcapActual results:File is not blocked and no reset is generatedExpected results:Firewall should block file and generate reset"," PSIRT-owner: psirt@cisco.com           This issue has been evaluated and driven to closure by PSIRT.

CSC.sys,c2921,alps,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCve54313,Crash in ALPS SNMP code," Symptom: The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subsystem of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software contains multiple vulnerabilities that could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to remotely execute code on an affected system or cause an affected system to reload. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected system via IPv4 or IPv6. Only traffic directed to an affected system can be used to exploit these vulnerabilities.  The vulnerabilities are due to a buffer overflow condition in the SNMP subsystem of the affected software. The vulnerabilities affect all versions of SNMP Versions 1, 2c, and 3. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 2c or earlier, the attacker must know the SNMP read-only community string for the affected system. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 3, the attacker must have user credentials for the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the affected system or cause the affected system to reload.

I did not test any versions outside of this range, but the bug has most likely been present since the day the code was released.The crash occurs because the ALPS snmp code calls the function alps_lib_toupper() passing in an attacker controlled length. That function blindly copies the number of bytes specified. All callers to that function must validate that the length being copied is less than the length of the destination buffer. It appears that there are several configuration commands that also call alps_lib_toupper, so it should also be possible to crash the router from the command line as well."," PSIRT-owner: psirt@cisco.com           This issue has been evaluated and driven to closure by PSIRT.

The vulnerability occurs because the affected software fails to perform sufficient validation and sanitization of user-supplied input when processing crafted URLs. An authenticated, remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability by convincing a user to follow a malicious link. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected site and allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.  Conditions: Device configured with default configuration.  Workaround: Not applicable or available.

CSC.content-security,esa,filters,customer-use,1,0,0,CSCvd29354,Cisco Email Security Appliance Denial of Service Vulnerability," Symptom: A vulnerability in the email message filtering feature of Cisco AsyncOS Software for the Cisco Email Security Appliance could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to run out of memory and stop scanning and  forwarding email messages. When system memory is depleted, it can cause the filtering process to crash, resulting in a  denial of service (DoS) condition on the device.  The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of email attachments that contain corrupted fields. An attacker could  exploit this vulnerability by sending an email message with an attachment that contains corrupted fields through a targeted  device. When the affected software filters the attachment, the filtering process could crash when the system runs out of memory  and the process restarts, resulting in a DoS condition. After the filtering process restarts, the software resumes filtering for the  same attachment, causing the filtering process to crash and restart again. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a repeated DoS condition.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

For further information, send a message to psirt@cisco.com.  (briandd-06/09/17)Symptom: A Cisco router configured as a IPSLA responder may experiencing a input queue wedge on the interface receiving the IPSLA control/data packets.  When the condition occurs, the show interface command will show the Input queue size is 1 above the max size:  Input queue: 76/75/27891/0 (size/max/drops/flushes); Total output drops: 254062  Once the input queue is wedged, other control traffic will not be able to received on that interface resulting in routing protocols dropping, not able to ping the interface, etc.  Conditions: The issue only occurs when the router is configured as a IPSLA responder.  The configuration command that enables this functionality is  ;ip sla responder ;.  Workaround: Once the interface is wedged, increasing the input queue size using the command  ;hold-queue xxx input ; on the physical interface may clear the condition.  Reloading the router is also known to clear the condition.  Disabling the IPSLA responder functionality is the only known mitigation action at this time.  Further Problem Description:","The customer has multiple routers (7200, 7300, 2900, ASR1K) configured as IPSLA responders which are experiencing periodic input queue wedges.  The packets stuck in the input queue are IPSLA udp-jitter packets destined to various UDP destination ports.

The vulnerability is due to an error on the programming of the TCAM entry where the ACL resides. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending fragmented IPv6 packets that may be forwarded by the device instead of being dropped.   Conditions: If an ACL like the following is configured on the device:  permit icmpv6 any any echo deny ipv6 any any  The expected outcome is that ICMPv6 Echo Request packets will be allowed, while all other IPv6 traffic would be dropped.  Due to an error in the TCAM programming where the ACL resides, a non-initial (ie: offset not equal to zero) IPv6 fragment carrying any L4 protocol will MATCH the first entry and be allowed. Expected behavior is for that traffic to match the second entry and be dropped.  There is no need for the ?permit? ACE to reference the ICMPv6 protocol - any ?permit?

This issue is a violation of Cisco's Product Security Baseline Requirements which are documented at the following link:  &lt;http://wwwin-eng.cisco.com/Eng/TechOps/Arch_Baselines/Baseline_Requirement_Documents/product-security-baseline.doc&gt;  The appropriate section is:  SEC-OFF-PROC	Selectively enable TCP/IP SERVICEs/OPEN PORTS  Colloquial Description Customers shouldn't have to let unneeded services run on their devices.  Condition MANDATORY for all PRODUCTS  Behavior It MUST be possible for an ADMINISTRATOR to separately enable or disable each provided TCP/IP SERVICE which is not ESSENTIAL to the PRODUCT, except that any set of TCP/IP SERVICES which are MUTUALLY ESSENTIAL may be configured as a group. It is not enough to apply a filter at some lower layer to keep traffic from reaching the LISTENER associated with the TCP/IP SERVICE. The LISTENER itself must be disabled, e.g. by not starting a process, not starting a thread, or not issuing a listen() call.  Enhanced behavior Similar configurability is RECOMMENDED for functions other than TCP/IP SERVICES, and especially for LISTENERs. Such configurability is likely to be REQUIRED for various classes of LISTENERs in the future.  Justification Any active LISTENER is a potential avenue for attack; not only do LISTENERS have bugs, but dispatching traffic to a LISTENER usually uses more system resources than discarding that traffic in a lower layer, creating a denial of service vulnerability. Nearly all security experts recommend disabling unneeded services whenever possible, and many customers have operating procedures based on those recommendations.  TCP/IP SERVICES are the most visible class of LISTENERs, one of the most frequently attacked classes, and the class most often subject to customer scrutiny. We have therefore chosen to address TCP/IP SERVICES in this  requirement. Fine-grained control is essential, since coarser control usually forces users to enable many unneeded services. Filters, even within a single operating system kernel, are prone to failure; it's usually easy for a developer or system administrator to make an error in creating a filter, or to make a change that creates a path around an existing filter without realizing it."

Additional information on Cisco's security vulnerability policy can be found at the following URL: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_policy.html  ","External researcher reported the following issues, both fixed within CSCva74756:Deviation #1: Rogue LSA with maximum sequence numberA false LSA having the maximum sequence number was sent from Cloud 1 to R1. The false LSA had an LS ID and Advertising Router fields that corresponds to R1's ID. In response R1 flooded over all its interfaces a new LSA having maximum sequence number and maximum age in order to flush the false LSA from all the routers in the network. This action is expected and is in accordance with the OSPF specification. Following the reception of the LSA Acks from all its neighbors R1 was expected to send yet another LSA, but this time with the minimum sequence number. However, R1 does not send this LSA. As a result, the LSA of R1 is not installed in the LS DB of the routers in the network, causing their DB to be inconsistent with the actual network topology. This allows an attacker to send a spoofed LSA that persistently harms the routing in the network.Issue #2:When a rogue R-LSA for Router-id 10.0.1.2 is sent with Max sequence number is sent from R0. R1 broadcasts the packet rogue R-LSA. R2 upon receiving the rogue LSA tries to max age out the rogue LSA entry by sending R-LSA with max sequence number and max age. R1 receives the packet and sends the ack. R2 after receiving the acks sends R-LSA with initial sequence number. R1 discards the new R-LSA from R2 as it considers the max sequence number what it has is newer. R1 again broadcast the R2's R-LSA with max sequence number and this process continues forever.Please contact srasovic@cisco.com or osantos@cisco.com for further information including researcher report and trace files and captures.Note: This vulnerability will be disclosed during Black Hat USA - end of July.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of PnP server responses. The PnP feature is only active while the device does not contain a configuration, such as a first time boot or after a factory reset has been issued. An attacker with the ability to respond to PnP configuration requests from the affected device can exploit the vulnerability by returning malicious PnP responses. If a Cisco APIC-EM is available on the network, the attacker would need to exploit the issue in the short window before a valid PnP response was received. If successful, the attacker could gain the ability to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the underlying operating system of the device.

In stored cross-site scripting, the application accepts input from an end user, stores it, and later displays it without properly encoding HTML metacharacters. This allows an attacker to inject JavaScript code into future views of the resulting page.The application filters out HTML metacharacters when filling out input fields on the web application by disallowing specific characters, even with request manipulation.  However, Malicious XSS payloads could be stored in the database by changing the hostname of a connected device to the desired JavaScript code. Once the device was connected to the network, ISE would immediately log hostname and other details regardless of its authentication properties.  When an admin user visits the ISE portal, the XSS payload is easily observed as the hostname appears in most logs found on the application.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation and output-encoding parameters for data that is passed between an affected client and server. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting targeted user packets and injecting malicious code into the targeted traffic stream. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject script code into the HTTP flow between the targeted user and the affected system.  For additional information about cross-site scripting attacks and the methods used to exploit these vulnerabilities, see the Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin Understanding Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Threat Vectors (https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoAppliedMitigationBulletin/cisco-amb-20060922-understanding-xss) and the OWASP reference page Cross-site Scripting (XSS) (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)).

In stored cross-site scripting, the application accepts input from an end user, stores it, and later displays it without properly encoding HTML metacharacters. This allows an attacker to inject JavaScript code into future views of the resulting page.The application filters out HTML metacharacters when filling out input fields on the web application by disallowing specific characters, even with request manipulation.  However, Malicious XSS payloads could be stored in the database by changing the hostname of a connected device to the desired JavaScript code. Once the device was connected to the network, ISE would immediately log hostname and other details regardless of its authentication properties.  When an admin user visits the ISE portal, the XSS payload is easily observed as the hostname appears in most logs found on the application. Recommendation:----------------Perform input validation and output encoding of all un-trusted data including the data obtained from device connections."," PSIRT-owner: srasovic           This issue is being considered for possible inclusion in a Security Advisory even though the Release-note Enclosure is already visible to customers.

CSC.datacenter,nexus-3000,platform,customer-use,6,0,0,CSCuv17837,NX-OS N3K Distributed reflective denial-of-service vulnerability NTP," Symptom: A vulnerability in Network Time Protocol (NTP) package of Cisco NX-OS Software and Cisco Multilayer Director Switch (MDS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to  cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition on an affected device.  The vulnerability is due to processing of MODE_PRIVATE (Mode 7) NTP control messages which have a large amplification vector. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by  sending Mode 7 control requests to NTP servers and observing responses amplified up to 5500 times in size. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS)  condition where the affected NTP server is forced to process and respond with large response data.  Conditions: This is a day 1 issue and all versions of NX-OS and MDS with support for NTP are vulnerable.  Fixed Software:   This bug will apply to the Cisco Nexus 7000 (N7K), Cisco Nexus 6000 (N6K), Cisco Nexus 5000 (N5K) and Cisco Multilayer Director Switch (MDS) and the fix is currently targeted for a release towards the end of  CY2015.  Cisco NX-OS Software and Cisco MDS switches are vulnerable to attacks utilizing Mode 7 NTP requests. Mode 7 requests can have amplification vector up to 5500.  To see if a device is configured with NTP, log into the device and issue the CLI command  ''show running-config | include ntp''. If the output returns either of the following commands  listed then the device is vulnerable:              ntp master          ntp peer          ntp server          ntp broadcast client         ntp multicast client      For a Cisco MDS switch to confirm the NTP feature is disabled:          # show running-config | include ''no feature ntp         no feature ntp  Information about Cisco NX-OS and MDS Software release naming conventions is available in  ''White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference  Guide'' at the following link:   http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html  Workaround: There are no solid workarounds other than disabling NTP on the device via the ''no feature ntp'' command. The following mitigations have been identified for this vulnerability; only  packets destined for any configured IP address on the device can exploit this vulnerability. Transit traffic will not exploit this vulnerability.      Note: NTP peer authentication is not a workaround and is still a vulnerable configuration.      * NTP Access Group      Warning: Because the feature in this vulnerability utilizes UDP as a transport, it is possible to spoof the  sender's IP address, which may defeat access control lists (ACLs) that permit communication to these ports  from trusted IP addresses. Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (Unicast RPF) should be  considered to be used in conjunction to offer a better mitigation solution.  Additionally, ''serve-only'' keyword added to the NTP access-group will limit the exposure of the server to  only respond to valid queries.  Note: NTP Access Group groups are not supported by the Cisco MDS switch.  For additional information on NTP access control groups, consult the document titled ''Cisco Nexus 7000 Series NX-OS System Management Configuration Guide, Release 4.x'' at  the following link:  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/datacenter/sw/4_2/nx-os/system_management/configuration/guide/sm_3ntp.html     * Infrastructure Access Control Lists      Warning: Because the feature in this vulnerability utilizes UDP as a transport, it is possible to spoof the  sender's IP address, which may defeat ACLs that permit communication to these ports from trusted IP addresses. Unicast RPF should be considered to be used in conjunction to  offer a better mitigation solution.      Although it is often difficult to block traffic that transits a network, it is possible to identify traffic that  should never be allowed to target infrastructure devices and block that traffic at the border of networks.    Infrastructure ACLs (iACLs) are a network security best practice and should be considered as a long-term addition to good network security as well as a workaround for this  specific vulnerability.  The white paper entitled ''Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists'' presents  guidelines and recommended deployment techniques for infrastructure protection access lists and is available at the following link:  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml      Cisco MDS Workaround for Management Interface  Step 0: The following configuration assumes a valid ntp configuration exists in the switch  for two ntp servers, x.x.x.x and y.y.y.y                                                                       Step 1: Remove any existing IP Access List from the mgmt 0 interface  configure terminal  interface mgmt 0  no ip access-group [existing ACL name] in    Step 2: Configure new IP Access List.

In summary, the attack is based on the premise of processing Mode 7 (MODE_PRIVATE) requests from the clients.  While the requests are small (for example, in case of Mode 7  only 8 bytes long), the response can grow up to 5500 times in amplification factor size.

CSC.sys,all,sla,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCvf37838,IPSLA responder input queue wedge," $$IGNORE-PSIRT  Symptom: A Cisco router configured as a IPSLA responder may experiencing a input queue wedge on the interface receiving the IPSLA control/data packets.  When the condition occurs, the show interface command will show the Input queue size is 1 above the max size:  Input queue: 76/75/27891/0 (size/max/drops/flushes); Total output drops: 254062  Once the input queue is wedged, other control traffic will not be able to received on that interface resulting in routing protocols dropping, not able to ping the interface, etc.  Conditions: The issue only occurs when the router is configured as a IPSLA responder.  The configuration command that enables this functionality is ""ip sla responder"".  Workaround: Once the interface is wedged, increasing the input queue size using the command ""hold-queue xxx input"" on the physical interface may clear the condition.  Reloading the router is also known to clear the condition.  Disabling the IPSLA responder functionality is the only known mitigation action at this time.  Further Problem Description: None  ","The customer has multiple routers (7200, 7300, 2900, ASR1K) configured as IPSLA responders which are experiencing periodic input queue wedges.  The packets stuck in the input queue are IPSLA udp-jitter packets destined to various UDP destination ports.  Once the input queue is wedged, other control traffic stops being received (BGP peers drop, can't ping the interface, etc).  This is occurring over a wide range of IOS / IOSXE versions (12.2(33)SB8a, 15.4M, 15.5(3)5S, etc).

This could allow the attacker to pass traffic to the default VLAN of the affected port.  The vulnerability is due to an uncaught error condition that may occur during the reassignment of the auth-default-ACL dynamic ACL to a switch port after 802.1x authentication fails. A successful exploit of this issue could allow a  physically adjacent attacker to bypass 802.1x authentication and cause the affected port to fail open, allowing the attacker to pass traffic to the default VLAN of the affected switch port.  There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link: https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170906-cat  Conditions: Cisco Catalyst 4000 series switches running Cisco IOS XE Software prior to version 3.6.7  Workaround: Administrators are advised to apply a port-specific ACL on all dynamic ACL access ports to act as a default if dynamic ACL assignment fails.   Further Problem Description:  The attacker must have physical access to an affected switch port to exploit the vulnerability.  The issue persists while the attacker maintains an electrical connection to the affected port or  until the 802.1x retry timer is hit.  When either the connection is electrically reset or the 802.1x retry is attempted a DACVL will again be applied to the port and the attacker would need to  attempt to re-exploit the vulnerability.

To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 2c or earlier, the attacker must know the SNMP read-only community string for the affected system. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 3, the attacker must have user credentials for the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the affected system or cause the affected system to reload.  Cisco will release software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  The advisory is available at the following link: https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170629-snmp  Conditions: Devices running an affected version of Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software.  Workaround: Administrators are advised to allow only trusted users to have SNMP access on an affected system. Administrators are also advised to monitor affected systems by using the show snmp host command in the CLI.  In addition, administrators can mitigate these vulnerabilities by disabling the following MIBs on a device:      ADSL-LINE-MIB     ALPS-MIB     CISCO-ADSL-DMT-LINE-MIB     CISCO-BSTUN-MIB     CISCO-MAC-AUTH-BYPASS-MIB     CISCO-SLB-EXT-MIB     CISCO-VOICE-DNIS-MIB     CISCO-VOICE-NUMBER-EXPANSION-MIB     TN3270E-RT-MIB  To create or update a view entry and disable the affected MIBs, administrators can use the snmp-server view global configuration command, as shown in the following example:      snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP iso included     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP internet included     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP snmpUsmMIB excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP snmpVacmMIB excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP snmpCommunityMIB excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoMgmt.252 excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP transmission.94 excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP mib-2.34.9 excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoMgmt.35 excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoMgmt.95 excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoMgmt.130 excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoMgmt.219 excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoMgmt.254 excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoMabMIB excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoExperiment.997 excluded  To then apply this configuration to a community string, administrators can use the following command:       snmp-server community mycomm view NO_BAD_SNMP RO  For SNMP Version 3, administrators can use the following command:       snmp-server group v3group auth read NO_BAD_SNMP write NO_BAD_SNMP  Further Problem Description: Customer are advised to utilize the Cisco IOS Software Checker or Contact Cisco TAC to determine if fixed software has been released for an affected platform.

This sender only needs to know the snmp community read string. The crash can be triggered by issuing the following command on any system that supports the snmpget program:snmpget -v2c -c <read-pwd> <address> `python -c ;print '1.3.6.1.4.1.9.10.997.1.1.1.1.2%s'%('.1'*114);`The crash is caused by a overflowing a stack variable, potentially allowing an attacker to gain control of the cpu program counter. I have recreated the crash as far back as 15.0(1)M. This crash does not require any voice configuration, the feature need only be present in the image. A datak9 license does need to be installed on the system.The crash occurs because the function k_cvNumExpnEntry_get() in sr_voicenumberexpmib.c creates a 65 byte buffer on the stack, and then blindly copies however many bytes are specified in the incoming request. I count 34 instances of this bad logic in the ss.comp1/uc_infra/src/voip directory. All of these callers to strncpy must validate that the length specified in the OID is less than the length of the destination buffer before doing the copy.This is related to CSCve60402, which was filed earlier against one of the other 34 instances of this bad logic."," PSIRT-owner: psirt@cisco.com           This issue has been evaluated and driven to closure by PSIRT.

CSC.voice,connection,conversations,customer-use,6,0,0,CSCux24578,Cisco Unity Connection Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerability," Symptom: A cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Cisco Unity Connection could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute unwanted actions.  The vulnerability is due to a lack of CSRF protections by an affected device. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by convincing a user to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to submit arbitrary requests to the affected device via the web browser with the privileges of the user.  Conditions: A device running an affected version of code.  Workaround: Users should verify that unsolicited links are safe to follow.  Further Problem Description: To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.  PSIRT Evaluation: The Cisco PSIRT has assigned this bug the following CVSS version 2 score. The Base and Temporal CVSS scores as of the time of evaluation are 4.3/4.1: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:U/RC:C&version=2.0  CVE ID CVE-2015-6408 has been assigned to document this issue.  Additional information on Cisco's security vulnerability policy can be found at the following URL: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_policy.html  ","Cisco Unity Connection was found to be vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF).  This means that it would be possible to spoof actions that can be performed by a user of the application.Victims must click a malicious link or visit a malicious webpage while logged in to the vulnerable application for a CSRF attack to succeed. This would cause the victim's browser to issue GET or POST requests to the vulnerable site by means of hidden images or embedded JavaScript code. Exploitation of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities also provides an effective means of delivering a CSRF attack.As the application did not sufficiently validate requests (such as by means of random tokens), it was unable to discern between forged requests and genuine actions performed by the real user clicking on elements within the application.Note that CSRF attacks are effective only if the user being attacked is logged in to the relevant application at the time the request is made. They take advantage of the fact that a user's browser will automatically submit the cookies associated with a particular domain in requests to that domain, regardless of where the request originated. Therefore, the use of session cookies is not a defence against CSRF."," PSIRT-owner: srasovic           PSIRT is reviewing this issue for possible inclusion in a Cisco Security  Advisory which could include this DDTs.

The vulnerability is due to the improper translation of H.323 messages that use the Registration, Admission, and Status (RAS) protocol and are sent to an affected device via IPv4 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted H.323 RAS packet through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to crash and reload, resulting in a DoS condition.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

CSC.netbu,pix-asa,crypto,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCuu66218,ASA is not correctly handling errors on AES-GCM ICV," Symptom: A vulnerability in the AES-GCM code of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to modify the contents of an encrypted IPSec or IKEv2 packet, and for those modifications not to be detected.  The vulnerability is due to an error on the firmware of the Cavium Networks cryptographic module. Due to this vulnerability, the ICV is not checked. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting encrypted packets in transit and modifying their contents. Such packets would be decrypted by the ASA and then forwarded to their destination, without the modification being detected.  Please note that this vulnerability does NOT allow an attacker to decrypt the packets in transit, nor obtain information about the session keys being used for the security association.  This vulnerability does NOT impact SSL/TLS traffic originated or destined to the ASA.  Conditions: An IKEv2 or an IPSec policy using any of the following algorithms for data encryption: aes-gcm, aes-gcm-192, aes-gcm-256.   This vulnerability only applies to the following ASA models: ASA5506-X (all hardware models), ASA5508-X, and ASA5516-X.  Workaround: There is no workaround for customers whose security policy requires the use of AES-GCM.  For customers that can use an alternative encryption algorith, IKE or IPSec policies using AES-GCM could be changed to use instead AES.

CSC.sys,all,isr-platform-snmp,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCve60376,Crash in ADSL DMT SNMP code," Symptom: The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subsystem of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software contains multiple vulnerabilities that could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to remotely execute code on an affected system or cause an affected system to reload. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected system via IPv4 or IPv6. Only traffic directed to an affected system can be used to exploit these vulnerabilities.  The vulnerabilities are due to a buffer overflow condition in the SNMP subsystem of the affected software. The vulnerabilities affect all versions of SNMP Versions 1, 2c, and 3. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 2c or earlier, the attacker must know the SNMP read-only community string for the affected system. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 3, the attacker must have user credentials for the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the affected system or cause the affected system to reload.  Cisco will release software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  The advisory is available at the following link: https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170629-snmp  Conditions: Devices running an affected version of Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software.  Workaround: Administrators are advised to allow only trusted users to have SNMP access on an affected system. Administrators are also advised to monitor affected systems by using the show snmp host command in the CLI.

CSC.sys,all,c7600-snmp,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCve66601,Crash in CISCO-SLB-EXT-MIB code," Symptom: The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subsystem of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software contains multiple vulnerabilities that could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to remotely execute code on an affected system or cause an affected system to reload. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected system via IPv4 or IPv6. Only traffic directed to an affected system can be used to exploit these vulnerabilities.  The vulnerabilities are due to a buffer overflow condition in the SNMP subsystem of the affected software. The vulnerabilities affect all versions of SNMP Versions 1, 2c, and 3. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 2c or earlier, the attacker must know the SNMP read-only community string for the affected system. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 3, the attacker must have user credentials for the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the affected system or cause the affected system to reload.  Cisco will release software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

I have recreated the crash in 15.5(3)S1, and as far back as 12.2(33)SXI9. The same code is present in the 15.6 sources. This crash does not require any special configuration, the server load balancing code need only be present in the image.The crash occurs because the function slb_lam_snmp_lookup_natpool() in sys/casa/slb_laminar_nm.c creates a 81 byte buffer on the stack, and then blindly copies the entire incoming request into that buffer. There are quite a few slb_lam_snmp_lookup_xxx functions that all appear to suffer the same logic flaw. All of these callers to strcpy must validate that the length of the incoming string is less than the length of the destination buffer before doing the copy."," PSIRT-owner: xabrouck           PSIRT is reviewing this issue for possible inclusion in a Cisco Security  Advisory which could include this DDTs.

CSC.content-security,esa,cli,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCui24838,OpenSSH LoginGraceTime Denial of Service vulnerability CVE-2010-5107," Symptom: Cisco Email Security Appliances are affected by the OpenSSH issue described by CVE-2010-5107. This issue stems from the default values utilized for the  MaxStartups parameter as supplied by OpenSSH.  To be exploited an attacker would need to have the ability to open SSH connections to the SSH Management port on the affected device.  If successful, they attacker could consume all available SSH connection slots provided by the SSH Daemon. By reconnecting within the timeout period specified by the service the attacker could keep all connections consumed for an extended period of time. This would result in the inability to access the SSH management console by authorized users. Any users that were connected via SSH at the time of the attack would continue to operate as expected.  Conditions: Cisco Email Security Appliance devices running an affected version of ESA software.  Workaround: Administrators can mitigate this issue by restricting SSH access to trusted workstations and networks only.  Further Problem Description: Because this attack relies on long timers and timeouts, it creates very little resource strain on an affected device.  Only the connection pool for the SSH service is affected.  Once the attack stops users can connect to the device normally.  This issue will be remediated in a future release of Cisco ESA software by the implementation of an SSH Whitelist daemon that will auto filter out malicious SSH connections.

The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly check for certain NULL values present in a CDP packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by by submitting crafted CDP requests to an affected device. The attacker would then need to convince a user to preform an SNMP poll of the affected MIB.. An attacker that can convince a user to preform an SNMP poll of the affected MIB could trigger a NULL Pointer error that results in a restart of the device.  This vulnerability affects versions 7.5, 7.6.100.0, and 7.6.110.0 only.  Conditions: Cisco Wireless LAN Controller running an affected version of CDP software.  Workaround: Affected customers may disable CDP on the WLC as an intermediate workaround prior to updating the software on the device.  Further Problem Description: This defect is resolved in WLC version 7.6.120.0  An attacker would need direct Layer-2 access to an affected device.

Additional information on Cisco's security vulnerability policy can be found at the following URL: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_policy.html ","When a Prime Services Catalog user performs an action on an instance they control (for example, powering it off, rebooting it, or suspending it), their browser makes a SOAP request to the PSC server. This request consists of user-controllable XML that is parsed by the requisition service. The XML parser used has XML External Entity (XXE) support enabled, which allows the XML document to ask the parser to include external resources (such as files on the server's filesystem) in its content. By specially crafting an XML document, an attacker can exfiltrate arbitrary data from the server that hosts the Prime Services Catalog. This is achievable via a number of vectors (see attachment). Due the default behavior of how the Java XML parsers handle external entities, this can be used to retrieve directory listings as well as individual files. XML entities can also be used in application-layer denial-of-service attacks by crafting an entity that can be sent as a small number of bytes but expands to a large block of data in memory. This is frequently called the ``billion laughs attack.''3 The billion laughs payload is less than a kilobyte when transferred, but consumes almost 3GB of memory on the application server when parsed.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient packet header validation at the 2nd stage normalizer in a dual normalizer setup. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted TCP  packet across the ASA that passes the first stage normalizer at ingress, but is then corrupted while being redirected to e.g. Snort so that it has an invalid options header when it arrives at the  second stage normalizer at egress.  Conditions: Running ASA in a dual normalizer configuration.  Workaround: There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Further Problem Description: ASA was crashing while it is processing the malformed TCP packet with an invalid options header. Due this ASA spends more time in TCP options processing and this is triggers the watch  dog, resulting in the crash.  PSIRT Evaluation: The Cisco PSIRT has assigned this bug the following CVSS version 3 score.

CSC.security,cids,sensorapp,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCuc74630,sensorApp process hangs due to job failure in Regex Hardware," Symptom: When one of the following operations are attempted on IPS sensor, it is found that sensorApp process is found to hang or become unresponsive: - Signature upgrade - Global correlation  - ''show statistics anomaly-detection'' command - ''clear database'' command  After this situation occurs, the sensorApp does not respond to any further commands or control transactions. Issuing a command like ''show statistics  virtual-sensor'' will not return any output and the command will time out after some time.  The mainApp finds that sensorApp is not responding to the collectStatistics control transactions that it sends, and hence logs the following error  message in main.log: ''collectStatistics failed: System error: Could not get user mode interface statistics [IntfManager::IntfcManager]''    In case of Global Correlation request leading to the hang, the evStatus ''Beginning to install a global-correlation update'' occurs, but the ''A global- correlation update installed successfully'' evStatus does NOT occur.  Conditions: Firing the control transaction ''getENGVirtualSensorStatistics'' before any of the above operations will show up a job failure. For example, from the service account, firing the following command before one of the above commands '/usr/cids/idsRoot/bin/sendCtlTrans getENGVirtualSensorStatistics' will report 1 'regex hardware search job failed'  This is applicable only to platforms having Regex Hardware, which includes the following IPS models: IPS 4510, IPS 4520 SSP10, SSP20, SSP40, SSP60 ASA 5525-X, ASA 5545-X, ASA 5555-X (with SSP running IPS); IPS 4345, IPS 4360  Note: The mere presence of collectStatistics failed errors in main.log does NOT indicate that this bug is hit. It is a generic error that would be logged  when sensorApp would become unresponsive to control transactions. Sometimes, sensorApp is unresponsive for a short while to mainApp, which  can mislead to mainApp to log collectStatistics errors. Also, the collectStatistics errors may be logged for reasons other than the specific issue related  to this DDTS. This bug is indicated by jobFailure in regex hardware when control transaction ''getENGVirtualSensorStatistics''' is triggered    Usage of any Signature packs between S673 to S687  Workaround: Reboot the sensor, and  Disable string-tcp, string-tcp-xl engines or disable signatures associated with these engines  If using any signature packs between S673 to S687, it is recommended to migrate to S688 or higher  PSIRT Evaluation: The Cisco PSIRT has assigned this bug the following CVSS version 2 score.

CSC.voice,connection,selinux,customer-use,1,0,0,CSCvg55128,Cisco Unity Connection unauthorized access vulnerability," Symptom: A vulnerability in the upgrade mechanism of Cisco collaboration products based on the Cisco Voice Operating System software platform could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized, elevated access to an affected device.  The vulnerability occurs when a refresh upgrade or Prime Collaboration Deployment (PCD) migration is performed on an affected device. When a refresh upgrade or PCD migration is completed successfully, an engineering flag remains enabled and could allow root access to the device with a known password.  If the vulnerable device is subsequently upgraded using the standard upgrade method to an Engineering Special Release, service update, or a new major release of the affected product, this vulnerability is remediated by that action.  Note: Engineering Special Releases that are installed as COP files, as opposed to the standard upgrade method, do not remediate this vulnerability.  An attacker who can access an affected device over SFTP while it is in a vulnerable state could gain root access to the device. This access could allow the attacker to compromise the affected system completely.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

The vulnerability is in the insecure SSL implementation of the affected operating system due to improper handling of SSL and Transport Layer Security  (TLS) security certificates.  The affected implementation could insecurely validate the certificate authority (CA) hierarchy and could trust illegitimate  certificates.  An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability by using a legitimate certificate to generate a security certificate for a third-party  domain.  The attacker would then attempt to convince an affected user to visit the domain and establish an SSL connection with the domain by using  the certificate provided. A successful attack could allow the attacker to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack against the affected user.  Conditions: Default configuration  Workaround: Administrators may consider configuring the WSA to drop invalid certificates.

The vulnerability is due to a faulty implementation of certain SNMP OIDs within the BRIDGE MIB.  An SNMP request for certain Object Identifiers (OIDs) within the BRIDGE MIB can cause the  device to reload unexpectedly. If an attacker knows the SNMP community string, they could exploit  this vulnerability by performing an authenticated SNMP request of the BRIDGE MIB OID to an  affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS as it could reload for each SNMP request.  Conditions: A device with SNMP configured running an affected version of software.  Workaround: 1.	SNMP can be removed from the configured.  2.	SNMP can be configured but cease polling of any BRIDGE MIB OIDs.  No Forthhcoming fix planned. We cannot reproduced it in lab.

The Cluster Management Protocol utilizes Telnet internally as a signaling and command protocol between cluster members. The vulnerability is due to the combination of two factors:   * The failure to restrict the use of CMP-specific Telnet options only to internal, local communications between cluster members and instead accept and process such options over any Telnet connection to an affected device, and  * The incorrect processing of malformed CMP-specific Telnet options.  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed CMP-specific Telnet options while establishing a Telnet session with an affected Cisco device configured to accept Telnet connections. An exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the device or cause a reload of the affected device.  Cisco will release software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

An authenticated, remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by submitting a malicious SNMP  query via UDP port 161 to trigger a buffer overflow condition in the SNMP and License Manager  components of the device. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary  code with elevated privileges.   SNMP is disabled by default and must be explicitly configured by an administrator. Because SNMP  is primarily a UDP-based protocol, no TCP three-way handshake is required to exploit this vulnerability,  and the malicious request could contain a spoofed origin. The attacker must know the configured  community strings for SNMP version 1 and version 2. Exploitation also requires a valid username  and password when a device is configured for SNMP version 3.  This vulnerability can be triggered via SNMP over IPv4 and SNMP over IPv6.  Conditions: The NX-OS device is configured for SNMP.  Workaround: The SNMP community string should be secure.

CSC.datacenter,n7k-pi,rtg-ospf,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCve47401,N3K/N9K/N7K OSPF Rogue LSA with maximum sequence number vulnerability," Symptom: Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability involving the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Routing Protocol Link State Advertisement (LSA) database. This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to take full control of the OSPF Autonomous System (AS) domain routing table, allowing the attacker to intercept or black-hole traffic.  The attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting crafted OSPF packets. Successful exploitation could cause the targeted router to flush its routing table and propagate the crafted OSPF LSA type 1 update throughout the OSPF AS domain.  To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must accurately determine certain parameters within the LSA database on the target router. This vulnerability can only be triggered by sending crafted unicast or multicast OSPF LSA type 1 packets. No other LSA type packets can trigger this vulnerability.  Fabric Shortest Path First (FSPF) protocol is not affected by this vulnerability.  Workarounds that address this vulnerability are available.

Additional information on Cisco's security vulnerability policy can be found at the following URL: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_policy.html  ","External researcher reported the following issues, both fixed within CSCva74756:Deviation #1: Rogue LSA with maximum sequence numberA false LSA having the maximum sequence number was sent from Cloud 1 to R1. The false LSA had an LS ID and Advertising Router fields that corresponds to R1's ID. In response R1 flooded over all its interfaces a new LSA having maximum sequence number and maximum age in order to flush the false LSA from all the routers in the network. This action is expected and is in accordance with the OSPF specification. Following the reception of the LSA Acks from all its neighbors R1 was expected to send yet another LSA, but this time with the minimum sequence number. However, R1 does not send this LSA. As a result, the LSA of R1 is not installed in the LS DB of the routers in the network, causing their DB to be inconsistent with the actual network topology. This allows an attacker to send a spoofed LSA that persistently harms the routing in the network.Issue #2:When a rogue R-LSA for Router-id 10.0.1.2 is sent with Max sequence number is sent from R0. R1 broadcasts the packet rogue R-LSA. R2 upon receiving the rogue LSA tries to max age out the rogue LSA entry by sending R-LSA with max sequence number and max age. R1 receives the packet and sends the ack. R2 after receiving the acks sends R-LSA with initial sequence number. R1 discards the new R-LSA from R2 as it considers the max sequence number what it has is newer. R1 again broadcast the R2's R-LSA with max sequence number and this process continues forever.Please contact srasovic@cisco.com or osantos@cisco.com for further information including researcher report and trace files and captures.Note: This vulnerability will be disclosed during Black Hat USA - end of July.

CSC.datacenter,ucs-blade-server,ucsm-security,customer-use,3,0,0,CSCul15478,OpenSSH CVE-2010-5107 Denial of Service Vulnerability," Symptom: Cisco Unified Computing System Fabric Interconnect Devices are affected by the OpenSSH issue described by CVE-2010-5107. This issue stems  from the default values utilized for the MaxStartups parameter as supplied by OpenSSH.  To be exploited an attacker would need to have the ability to  open SSH connections to the SSH Management port on the affected device.  If successful, they attacker could consume all available SSH connection  slots provided by the SSH Daemon.  By reconnecting within the timeout period specified by the service the attacker could keep all connections  consumed for an extended period of time.  This would result in the inability to access the SSH management console by authorized users. Any users that  were connected via SSH at the time of the attack would continue to operate as expected.  Because this attack relies on long timers and timeouts, it creates very little resource strain on an affected device.  Only the connection pool for the SSH  service is affected.  Once the attack stops users can connect to the device normally.  Conditions: Devices running an affected version of Cisco UCS software.  Workaround: Aministrators can mitigate this issue by restricting SSH access to trusted workstations and networks only.  Further Problem Description: This issue will be remediated in a future release of Cisco Unified Computing System software. It is likely that this fix will take the form of a change to the  default startup values for OpenSSH and will not be a package upgrade to OpenSSH 6.2.

Symptom:The web server included with the WSA is potentially vulnerable to the CRIME vulnerability (CVE-2012-4929).  Conditions: Workaround:The CRIME vulnerability can only be exploited if both the server and web browser both support TLS compression.Almost all modern web browsers disable compression for TLS connections.  To avoid any potential exposure to this vulnerability, please ensure that your browser does not support TLS compression.  All versions of Internet Explorer, and the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox do not support TLS compression and are therefore not vulnerable to the CRIME exploit. More Info:The CRIME vulnerability can be exploited via TLS or SPDY compression.  We do not support the SPDY protocol currently, so only TLS compression is potentially vulnerable.  ","This defect is cloned from CSCum72269 so we can have an WSA defect for this issue.  I have performed testing on an WSA running 8.0.0-393 and found it to be vulnerable to this defect as well.A security scan by Qualys is detecting ESAs running AsyncOS 8.0.1-023 as being vulnerable to the CRIME security exploit.

The crash can be triggered by issuing the following command on any system that supports the snmpget program:snmpget -v2c -c <read-pwd> <address> 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.35.1.2.1.1.5.67108864The crash is caused by a indexing into an array with an attacker controlled index value. (Smaller final numbers in the OID will allow an attacker to read the contents of memory.) I could only recreate the crash in versions 15.3(3)M1 and later, even though the unprotected array index has always been preset in IOS. Bstun does not need to be configured or enabled for this vulnerability to exist. It only needs to be present in the image. The c2900 I tested with also required a uck9 or data9 license to be present.The crash occurs because the BSTUN snmp code calls the function snmp_get_group, passing in an attacker controlled bstunGroupIndex variable. That function indexes into an array without first validating the index value. Smaller index values allow reading memory past the end of the array; larger index values crash the router by trying to read a non-existent memory address."," PSIRT-owner: elparis@cisco.com           This issue has been evaluated and driven to closure by PSIRT.

CSC.sys,all,bgp,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCvg52875,Cisco IOS XE Software Ethernet Virtual Private Network Border Gateway Protocol DOS Vulnerability," Symptom: A vulnerability in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) over an Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) for Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated,  remote attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition, or potentially corrupt the BGP routing table, which could result in  network instability.  The vulnerability exists due to changes in the implementation of the BGP MPLS-Based Ethernet VPN RFC (RFC 7432) draft between IOS XE software releases.  When the BGP Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag Route or BGP EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement Route update packet is received, it could be possible that the IP address  length field is miscalculated. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted BGP packet to an affected device after the BGP session was established.  An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload or corrupt the BGP routing table; either outcome would result in a DoS.  The Cisco implementation of the BGP protocol only accepts incoming BGP traffic from explicitly defined peers. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to  send the malicious packets over a TCP connection that appears to come from a trusted BGP peer, or inject malformed messages into the victim's BGP network. This  would require obtaining information about the BGP peers in the affected system's trusted network.  The vulnerability may be triggered when the router receives a crafted BGP message from a peer on an existing BGP session. At least one BGP neighbor session  must be established for a router to be vulnerable.  There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Because browsers automatically add cookies to requests regardless of their origin, it may be possible for an attacker to create a malicious web site that forges a cross-domain request to the vulnerable application. For a request to be vulnerable to CSRF, the following conditions must hold:The request can be issued cross-domain, for example using an HTML form. If the request contains non-standard headers or body content, then it may only be issuable from a page that originated on the same domain.The application relies solely on HTTP cookies or Basic Authentication to identify the user that issued the request. If the application places session-related tokens elsewhere within the request, then it may not be vulnerable.The request performs some privileged action within the application, which modifies the application's state based on the identity of the issuing user.The attacker can determine all the parameters required to construct a request that performs the action.

Parent Defect: CSCve53542 ###The Open Agent Container (OAC) runs as root, but drops several capabilities for security reasons. However,it does not drop the cap_net_raw capability, which allows users inside the container to read and send arbitrary packets on any of the Linux network interfaces. By crafting specific packets, a local attacker can communicate with unintended services on the device-internal network. Several of these services allow running code without authentication or with only host-based verification, which can be easily bypassed by spoofing the source address. A local attacker with access to the OAC could use this to break out of the container and run code on the host operating system.The OAC must be configured to drop the cap_net_raw capability upon startup."," PSIRT-owner: psirt@cisco.com           This issue has been evaluated and driven to closure by PSIRT.

CSC.sys,all,isr-platform-snmp,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCve60276,Crash in ADSL SNMP code," Symptom: The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subsystem of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software contains multiple vulnerabilities that could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to remotely execute code on an affected system or cause an affected system to reload. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected system via IPv4 or IPv6. Only traffic directed to an affected system can be used to exploit these vulnerabilities.  The vulnerabilities are due to a buffer overflow condition in the SNMP subsystem of the affected software. The vulnerabilities affect all versions of SNMP Versions 1, 2c, and 3. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 2c or earlier, the attacker must know the SNMP read-only community string for the affected system. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 3, the attacker must have user credentials for the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the affected system or cause the affected system to reload.  Cisco will release software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  The advisory is available at the following link: https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170629-snmp  Conditions: Devices running an affected version of Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software.  Workaround: Administrators are advised to allow only trusted users to have SNMP access on an affected system. Administrators are also advised to monitor affected systems by using the show snmp host command in the CLI.  In addition, administrators can mitigate these vulnerabilities by disabling the following MIBs on a device:      ADSL-LINE-MIB     ALPS-MIB     CISCO-ADSL-DMT-LINE-MIB     CISCO-BSTUN-MIB     CISCO-MAC-AUTH-BYPASS-MIB     CISCO-SLB-EXT-MIB     CISCO-VOICE-DNIS-MIB     CISCO-VOICE-NUMBER-EXPANSION-MIB     TN3270E-RT-MIB  To create or update a view entry and disable the affected MIBs, administrators can use the snmp-server view global configuration command, as shown in the following example:      snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP iso included     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP internet included     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP snmpUsmMIB excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP snmpVacmMIB excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP snmpCommunityMIB excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoMgmt.252 excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP transmission.94 excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP mib-2.34.9 excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoMgmt.35 excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoMgmt.95 excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoMgmt.130 excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoMgmt.219 excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoMgmt.254 excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoMabMIB excluded     snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoExperiment.997 excluded  To then apply this configuration to a community string, administrators can use the following command:       snmp-server community mycomm view NO_BAD_SNMP RO  For SNMP Version 3, administrators can use the following command:       snmp-server group v3group auth read NO_BAD_SNMP write NO_BAD_SNMP  Further Problem Description: Customer are advised to utilize the Cisco IOS Software Checker or Contact Cisco TAC to determine if fixed software has been released for an affected platform.

This crash does not require any configuration of ADSL, the feature need only be present in the image.The crash occurs because the function k_adslLineConfProfileEntry_get() in sr_adslmib.c creates a 33 byte buffer on the stack, and then blindly copies however many bytes are specified in the incoming request.

The vulnerability is due to lack of protecting confidential information at rest in response to SNMP poll requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by doing a crafted SNMP poll request to the targeted security appliance. An exploit could allow the attacker to discover confidential information which should be restricted and the attacker could use this information to conduct additional reconnaissance attacks. The attacker would have knowledge of the configured SNMP community string to exploit this vulnerability.  Conditions: The security appliance is configured for SNMP polling.  Workaround: A mitigation for this vulnerability is to disable SNMP. If SNMP is not enabled the device is not vulnerable.  Further Problem Description: None.

The vulnerability occurs because AAA processes prevent the NX-OS System Manager from receiving keepalive messages when an affected device receives a high rate of login attempts, such as in a brute-force login attack. System memory can run low on the FXOS devices under the same conditions, which could cause the AAA process to unexpectedly restart or cause the device to reload.  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing a brute-force login attack against a device that is configured with AAA security services. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

This may enable a ;clickjacking; attack, in which the attacker's page overlays the target application's interface with a different interface provided by the attacker. By inducing victim users to perform actions such as mouse clicks and keystrokes, the attacker can cause them to unwittingly carry out actions within the application that is being targeted. This technique allows the attacker to circumvent defenses against cross-site request forgery, and may result in unauthorized actions.Note that this issue is being reported because the application's response does not set a suitable X-Frame-Options header in order to prevent framing attacks. Some applications attempt to prevent these attacks from within the HTML page itself, using ;framebusting; code. However, this type of defense is normally ineffective and can usually be circumvented by a skilled attacker.Issue remediationYou should review the application functions that are accessible from within the response, and determine whether they can be used by application users to perform any sensitive actions within the application. If so, then a framing attack targeting this response may result in unauthorized actions.To effectively prevent framing attacks, the application should return a response header with the name X-Frame-Options and the value DENY to prevent framing altogether, or the value SAMEORIGIN to allow framing only by pages on the same origin as the response itself.See attached burp proxy report"," PSIRT-owner: psirt@cisco.com           This issue has been evaluated and driven to closure by PSIRT.

Additional information on Cisco's security vulnerability policy can be found at the following URL: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_policy.html  ","The Mediasense applications are vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF).  This means it would be possible to spoof actions that can be performed by a user of the application (such as changing the account password, adding accounts, uploading files).  Victims must click a malicious link or visit a malicious webpage while logged in to the vulnerable application for this to occur.A maliciously-crafted page would cause the user's browser to issue GET or POST requests to the vulnerable site by means of hidden images or embedded JavaScript code. Exploitation of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities also provides an effective means of delivering a CSRF attack.Recommendation:The primary defence against CSRF is to create one-time tokens (nonces) that are placed on the page and validated on the server side, to ensure that requests can only be executed once. The received nonce for a given form in a given session must match server-side information.Every significant action that can be performed within the application should be secured by means of random tokens of sufficient length to be non-guessable. If the correct token value is not received with the requested action, the action should not be performed and the user's session should be invalidated under suspicion of malicious activity.Sensitive functions should require additional authentication tokens; for example, a form which allows a user to change their password should request the current password.In addition, the incoming request referrer header could be validated to check that the request originated from an expected application URL, although this is not a sufficient defense on its own, as referrer headers can be modified or tampered with.Browser manufacturers have begun to add support for cross-origin resource sharing headers to manage cross-site requests. From the server perspective, this may typically involve setting an Access-Control-Allow-Origin header and examining request Origin headers."," PSIRT-owner: psirt@cisco.com           This issue has been evaluated and driven to closure by PSIRT.

Additional information on Cisco's security vulnerability policy can be found at the following URL: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_policy.html  ",The ASA looks at the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to determine the location from which it loads libraries. /etc/init.d/rcS~(linux/buildroot/project_build/asa-dev/root/etc/init.d/rcS~) exports this variable as follows:export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/mnt/disk0/lib:/mnt/disk0/libXpix/linux/def_config/rcS.common exports this variable as follows:echo ;export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/mnt/disk0/lib:/asa/lib:/mnt/disk/csco_config/lib;              >> /tmp/run_cmdThe inclusion of /mnt/disk0/lib exposes the ASA to malicious libraries. A user can create the lib directory on the flash memory of the ASA and place a library there that would get loaded and run whenever the ASA boots. This library would replace the standard library that is intended to be loaded (e.g. libc.so.6). Such a library could be written to give the user access to any part of the ASA they wanted without restriction. This could allow a common user to get to the Linux underlying LINA. It could also permit a denial-of-service that prevents the ASA from ever booting.Libraries should be packaged with the cdisk image at build time and never externally loaded at run time to secure the ASA device. Removing flash memory from the library load path would effectively accomplish this. Any path including disk0 or disk1 should be removed from LD_LIBRARY_PATH.This issue was brought forward years ago (2006) by CSCsf26402 but the patch committed was eventually reversed by CSCsh39879 and CSCsi02466.," PSIRT-owner: psirt@cisco.com           This issue has been evaluated and driven to closure by PSIRT.

Note that the pattern can occur in an iframe, so there is not necessarily any user-visible indication of what is happening, visiting any website would be enough.The extension uses nativeMessaging, so this magic string is enough for any website to execute arbitrary code (!!).The protocol the extension uses is complicated, using CustomEvent() objects to pass JSON messages between the webpage, the extension and the native code.Stepping through an initialization, a website must first request that the extension open a port for communication, like this:document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent(;connect;, { detail: { token: ;token; }})); // token can be any stringThen messages can passed to native code via ;message; events. Note that these cannot be MessageEvent() objects, and you cannot use the postMessage API, they have to be CustomEvent() objects.There are a few different message types, such as ;hello;, ;disconnect;, etc. The most interesting is ;launch_meeting;:    document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent(;message;, { detail: {            message: JSON.stringify(msg),            message_type: ;launch_meeting;,            timestamp: (new Date()).toUTCString(),            token: ;token;        }    }));See Large Description."," PSIRT-owner: psirt@cisco.com           This issue has been evaluated and driven to closure by PSIRT.

The vulnerability occurs because AAA processes prevent the NX-OS System Manager from receiving keepalive messages when an affected device receives a high rate of login attempts, such as in a brute-force login attack. System memory can run low on the FXOS devices under the same conditions, which could cause the AAA process to unexpectedly restart or cause the device to reload.  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing a brute-force login attack against a device that is configured with AAA security services. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

CSC.csg,train,mcclient,customer-use,1,0,0,CSCvc51227,Cisco WebEx Network Recording Player Buffer Overflow Vulnerability," Symptom: Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the Cisco WebEx Network Recording Player for Advanced Recording Format (ARF) files. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by providing a user with a malicious ARF file via email or URL and convincing the user to launch the file.  Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause an affected player to crash and, in some cases, could allow arbitrary code execution on the system of a targeted user.  The Cisco WebEx Network Recording Player is an application that is used to play back WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded on the computer of an online meeting attendee. The player can be automatically installed when the user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx server.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link: https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170621-wnrp  Conditions: This vulnerability affects the Cisco WebEx ARF Player. The following client builds are affected by this vulnerability:  Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS29) client builds prior to T29.13.130 Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS30) client builds prior to T30.17 Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS31) client builds prior to T31.10  To determine whether a Cisco WebEx meeting site is running an affected version of the WebEx client build, users can log in to their Cisco WebEx meeting site and go to the Support  Downloads section. The version of the WebEx client build will be displayed on the right side of the page under ''About Support Center.''  Alternatively, version information of the Cisco WebEx Meeting client can be accessed from within the Cisco WebEx Meeting client. Version information for the Cisco WebEx meeting client on Windows and Linux platforms can be viewed by choosing Help  About Cisco WebEx Meeting Center.  Version information for the Cisco WebEx meeting client on Mac platforms can be viewed by choosing Meeting Center  About Cisco WebEx Meeting Center.  The Cisco WebEx software updates are cumulative in client builds. For example, if client build 29.32.16 is fixed, build 29.32.17 will contain updated software. Cisco WebEx site administrators have access to secondary version nomenclature, for example, T29 SP32 EP16, which shows that the server is running client build 29.32.16.  Note: Customers who do not receive automatic software updates may be running versions of Cisco WebEx that have reached end of software maintenance and should contact customer support.  Workaround: There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, it is possible to remove all WebEx software completely from a system using the Meeting Services Removal Tool (for Microsoft Windows users) or Mac Cisco-WebEx Uninstaller (for Apple Mac OS X users) available at https://help.webex.com/docs/DOC-2672.

CSC.content-security,esa,wui_tech_support,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCuo96011,ESA - weak hardening of support account credential algorithm," Symptoms:  Cisco ESA includes a functionality to allow Cisco support personnel to remotely connect to the device for troubleshooting purpose. The device includes an account that is used to provide this connection. This account can be enabled and disabled by the Cisco ESA administrator and it is turned off by default. To enable the account the Cisco ESA administrator needs to select a pass-phrase that this then used as seed to an algorithm that will calculate the final password to access the device for a support representative.  The algorithm to generate the account password, starting from the pass-phrase selected by the administrator, has been found not properly protected within the Cisco ESA binary so an attacker could potentially access this algorithm and retrieve the final support account password if he has the knowledge of the pass-phrase set by the device administrator.  This bug is open to increase the security of the algorithm and store it in a better way on the device.  This issue has been reported to Cisco by Glafkos Charalambous.  Conditions:  An attacker would need to have a knowledge of the pass-phrase that the Cisco ESA admin used when enabled the support account, and have the support account enabled  Workaround:  When not in use, support account should be disabled.  Further Problem Description: The issue has been fixed by changing the algorithm and harden the protection of the algorithm in the code. Additionally password complexity will be enforced on the pass-phrase used before enabling the account.  This is fixed in the following versions: ASYNCOS 8.0.2-066  GD build ASYNCOS 8.5.6-092  GD build   PSIRT Evaluation: The Cisco PSIRT has assigned this bug the following CVSS version 2 score.

CSC.sys,all,bgp,customer-use,3,0,0,CSCui67191,Cisco IOS XE Software Ethernet Virtual Private Network Border Gateway Protocol DOS Vulnerability," Symptom: A vulnerability in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) over an Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) for Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition, or potentially corrupt the BGP routing table, which could result in network instability.  The vulnerability exists due to changes in the implementation of the BGP MPLS-Based Ethernet VPN RFC (RFC 7432) draft between IOS XE software releases. When the BGP Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag Route or BGP EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement Route update packet is received, it could be possible that the IP address length field is miscalculated. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted BGP packet to an affected device after the BGP session was established. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload or corrupt the BGP routing table; either outcome would result in a DoS.  The Cisco implementation of the BGP protocol only accepts incoming BGP traffic from explicitly defined peers. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to send the malicious packets over a TCP connection that appears to come from a trusted BGP peer, or inject malformed messages into the victim's BGP network. This would require obtaining information about the BGP peers in the affected system's trusted network.  The vulnerability may be triggered when the router receives a crafted BGP message from a peer on an existing BGP session. At least one BGP neighbor session must be established for a router to be vulnerable.  There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

A remote,  unauthenticated attacker who can compromise or control the response of a H.323 gateway configured on Call Manager could respond to ISDN call  setup requests with a malformed response.  When parsed, this response could cause CUCM to Restart.  Conditions: Devices running an affected version of Cisco Unified Call Manager and configured to utilize a H.323 gateway.  Workaround: None.  Further Problem Description: This issue was discovered during an investigation of a customer case.  It was found that a 3rd Party H.323 gateway was responding with an invalid  H.323 response when passed a Dial String of 21 digits or greater.  The response which violated the ISDN protocol when parsed resulted in the crash.   While this issue has only been seen in very specific circumstances, an attacker that was able to compromise a configured H.323 gateway could  leverage the issue to create a denial of service condition on Cisco Unified Call Manager.

(tfinn-06/09/17)  $$IGNORE-PSIRT  Symptoms: A vulnerability in the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)-TLS certificate handling  during SSL connection setup for the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an  unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the ISE application server to unexpectedly restart.  The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of the client EAP-TLS certificate. An  attacker could exploit this vulnerability by initiating a SSL connection to the ISE with a crafted  EAP-TLS certificate. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition due to the ISE  application server restarting. The ISE application could continue to restart while the client  attempts the SSL connection.  The same EAP-TSL certificate if imported to the ISE trust store by an administrator user could  cause the same DoS condition. This exploit would require valid administrator credentials.  Conditions: TBD - Vulnerable versions.  Workaround: None.  Further Problem Description: None.  PSIRT Evaluation: The Cisco PSIRT has assigned this bug the following CVSS version 3 score.

CSC.sys,all,udp,customer-use,3,0,0,CSCup10024,Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE input queue holding Vulnerability," Symptom: A vulnerability in the UDP processing code of Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the input queue of an affected system to hold UDP packets, causing an interface queue wedge and a denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerability is due to Cisco IOS Software application changes that create UDP sockets and leave the sockets idle without closing them. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending UDP packets with a destination port of 0 to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause UDP packets to be held in the input interfaces queue, resulting in a DoS condition. The input interface queue will stop holding UDP packets when it receives 250 packets.  There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.

The vulnerability is due to spoofed, ingress packets causing the affected device to blacklist certain traffic flows when set to use default system policies, impacting the device to properly return outbound traffic, where no specific Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) sequence exists. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending maliciously crafted packets to a device which target known protocols and ports running on certain applications within an affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a partial impact to services running on the device.  Conditions: Please refer to the security advisory.  Workaround: Please refer to the security advisory.   Further Problem Description: Please refer to the security advisory.

Additional information on Cisco's security vulnerability policy can be found at the following URL: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_policy.html","An attacker can craft packets to be sourced from whatever IP. If the Access Control policy blocks all inbound packets an attacker could completely shut down outbound communication to certain IPs based on this. For example, if I were to send 65535 packets such as: Source IP (domain of cisco.com, lets just say this is 1.1.1.1 for example's sake)Source Port 443Destination IP would be a client IP you want to block access to cisco.com, so just for example lets say this is 10.0.0.1.Destination port: 1-65535 If an attacker sent all of these packets at once snort would create a session for all of these where the initiator IP is 1.1.1.1 (cisco.com) and if this hit a block rule in the AC policy (which most firewalls run a block all default action for inbound traffic) then this would create 65535 sessions between these 2 IPS that would be blacklisted until they timed out, or the attacker could keep transmitting reset packets, essentially making the timeout unlimited, then 10.0.0.1 would never be able to open a TCP connection with 1.1.1.1 on port 443 because all of the 5 tuple sessions would be blacklisted.The intent of this bug is to address the issue where a teardown packet (eg FIN/RST) or a packet with no data causes a blacklist verdict and will block packets from the same session in both directions. These packets should not create a session and should only be dropped, not blacklisted. This will ensure a new session using the same 5-tuple will subsequently be allowed.Steps to reproduce:1)	Configure an inline set on FTD with an any any allow AC rule, with an IPS policy associated with the rule.2)	Configure the following Snort rule in the above IPS policy:        drop tcp any any <> any any ( sid:10000002; flags:*F; )3)	Send a FIN packet, observe that it gets dropped and blacklisted by the above rule4)	Send a SYN packet with the same 5-tuple as the FIN packetActual results: SYN packet is droppedExpected results: SYN packet is not dropped"," PSIRT-owner: psirt@cisco.com           This issue has been evaluated and driven to closure by PSIRT.

The authentication was done by a unsuspecting third party.  The vulnerability exists because there is no mechanism to detect that Identity Provider (IdP) and AnyConnect SAML authenticate request are from the same device. An attacker could exploit  this vulnerabilityby persuading a user to click on a crafted link, which for example was sent via email, and authenticate using the company IdP. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to  hijack an authenticated AnyConnect session throug the ASA.

Additional information on Cisco's security vulnerability policy can be found at the following URL: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_policy.html  ","Hi, We have discovered that it is possible to bypass attachment policies in the Cisco Ironport product (we are using version 10.0.0.-203). By having multiple Content-type's where one of them is multipart/mixed, Ironport lets mail through, apparently without noticing that an attachment is preset. Our mail client software shows the attachment in a mail received via Ironport. Since the attachment isn't identified as such, it never triggers the Ironport content rules in place (no windows executable policy) and it is therefore possible to deliver any type of file to the recipient this way. Having multiple content types is probably in violation of some MIME/SMTP RFC's so technically Ironport could be correct here by not identifying an attachment but we feel it should then be rejected or at least having the option to block this kind of message.

If this memory leak persists over time, a denial of service (DoS) condition could develop because traffic can cease to be forwarded through the device.  The vulnerability is due to an error in how the Firepower Detection Snort Engine handles SSL traffic decryption and notifications to and from the Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) handler. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a steady stream of malicious Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) traffic through the device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition when the device runs low on system memory.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

This defect is that its not possible to get the ethernet packets that L4TM is interested in, to be sent over to IPFW to be filtered.   This means that we see none of the DNS packets that we would filter to populate the tables, and we no longer block or log, the IPs that L4TM should be keying off of.   Freebsd 9 has this sysctl setting that would send bridged packets over to L4TM ;net.link.ether.bridge_ipfw: 1;  Freebsd 10 does not, and there appears to be no other way to send the packets we are interested in, over to be filtered.Repro: (Need a WSA wired for L4TM)1) Configure a L4TM rule to block an IP.2) Run a transparent request through your WSA to that IP, it won't get blocked.Our current implementation of L4TM uses the ipfw rule of layer2, to identify any L4TM packets from T1/T2.  With freebsd 10, the ipfw count of any packets matching a layer2 rule will be zero.  It is possible to send layer2 packets over to IPFW, by setting ;net.link.ether.ipfw;  (Enabling this setting will make your WSA network unreachable, unless you modify the ipfw rules first).  This setting is not a global setting, cause it only gets us the layer 2 packets intended for this WSA, not the bridged ones, and the bridged ones are what we need for L4TM to function."," PSIRT-owner: jelanza  This issue has been evaluated and driven to closure by PSIRT.

CSC.netbu,pix-asa,data-path,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCub63148,With inline IPS and heavy load ASA could drop ICMP or DNS replies," Symptom:Intermittently, DNS reply packets, or ICMP echo reply packets, might be dropped by the ASA.  Conditions:To encounter this bug, an ASA IPS module must be in-line with the traffic flow. The IPS module must be under heavy processing load.   Additionally, for DNS traffic to be affected, the dns-guard feature must be enabled (it is enabled by default)  For ICMP echo-replies to be affected, the 'inspect icmp' feature must be enabled (it is disabled by default)  Workaround: - Reduce the processing load on the IPS, by reducing the amount of traffic sent to it - Exempt the affected traffic from IPS inspection - Change the IPS processing from 'in-line' to 'promiscuous'  In the case of ICMP echo replies being dropped, disable 'inspect icmp'  In the case of DNS replies being dropped, disable dns-guard. This should be done with caution, since with dns-guard disabled, each DNS connection will remain in the ASA's connection table until the UDP timeout applies to the connection. This could result in a significant amount of additional UDP connections in the ASA's connection table:  ------------------------------------ policy-map type inspect dns preset_dns_map  parameters   message-length maximum client auto   message-length maximum 512   no dns-guard            ----- HERE policy-map global_policy  class inspection_default   inspect dns preset_dns_map    inspect ftp    inspect h323 h225    inspect h323 ras    inspect rsh    inspect rtsp    inspect esmtp    inspect sqlnet    inspect skinny     inspect sunrpc    inspect xdmcp    inspect sip     inspect netbios    inspect tftp    inspect ip-options    inspect icmp   class IPS   ips inline fail-open ! service-policy global_policy global ------------------------------------ More Info:When this problem is encountered, the ASA drops the packet and will increment the following ASP drop counter:  (flow-expired) Expired flow  This can be seen with the output of 'show asp drop' on the ASA:  ASA#show asp drop ...

The vulnerability is due to Cisco IOS Software application changes that create UDP sockets and leave the sockets idle without closing them. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending UDP packets with a destination port of 0 to an affected device.

The Identity Firewall cache maintains a list of authenticated clients which the ASA uses to make packet filtering decisions. CoA packets can be captured and replayed at will, thereby controlling the ASA's knowledge of authenticated clients and its security policy actions.Technical DetailsIt is not required that the user be present in the ASA Identity Firewall cache at all for the replay to be successful. If the user is not present (neither Inactive nor Login) in the user cache, the user will be added to the cache and set to the Login state. If the user is present in the cache, but in the Inactive state, the user will be changed to the Login state.Attack ScenarioAn attacker could replay a RADIUS CoA, destined for an ASA that has a user or group access-control list configured, that adds a user-to-ip mapping to the ASA for an IP that the attacker obtains or spoofs. This would allow the attacker to bypass Active Directory authentication and the requirement for a user-to-ip mapping to be present in the AD Agent/CDA cache, and obtain unauthorized access through the ASA."," PSIRT-owner: psirt@cisco.com           This issue has been evaluated and driven to closure by PSIRT.

CSC.netbu,pix-asa,access-list,customer-use,3,0,0,CSCuf79091,Cisco ASA time-range object may have no effect,"  Symptom:  The access-list is not effective when configured with a time-range object   Conditions:  Currently this was noticed when the time-range object is configured with the ''periodic'' command and spanning over two or more consecutive days. Example of affected configuration is:  time-range WEEKEND   periodic Saturday 0:00 to Sunday 23:59  An access-list configured with the time-range object above will not have any effect.  To verify if you are affected by this issue, you can use the show time-range command while the time-range should be effective and verify that the command show the rule as inactive:  ciscoasa#show time-range  time-range entry: WEEKEND (inactive)     periodic Saturday 0:00 to Sunday 23:59     used in: IP ACL entry    Workaround:  Configuring the time-range object in a different way, may workaround this issue. Example of working configuration are:  time-range WEEKEND1   periodic Saturday 0:00 to 23:59   periodic Sunday 0:00 to 23:59  or  time-range WEEKEND2   periodic weekend 0:00 to 23:59   Further Problem Description:  A vulnerability in the implementation of the time-range object  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to by-pass access-list that are using the time-range option.  The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of the code for the time-range object, when the periodic command is used. Due to this issue the time-range object will have no effect, thus depending on the access-list statement, (permit or deny), this may allow an attacker to by-pass the access-list statement.

CSC.policy-mgmt,positron,infra-cars,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCur00532,ISE evaluation for CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169 (AKA ShellShock)," Symptom: The Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) includes a version of bash that is affected by the vulnerabilities identified by the Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) IDs:  CVE-2014-6271 CVE-2014-7169 CVE-2014-7186 CVE-2014-7187 CVE-2014-6277 CVE-2014-6278  All shipping versions of ISE are vulnerable to  CVE-2014-6271,  CVE-2014-7169, CVE-2014-7186, CVE-2014-7187, CVE-2014-6277, CVE-2014-6278  (AKA ShellShock bug). That said, the exposure of this bug in ISE is very  limited.  The shellshock vulnerability allows an AUTHENTICATED SSH user  run a generic Linux command.  The key word being 'AUTHENTICATED'.  Hence if an attacker does not have the username and password of an ISE CLI user, they will not be able to exploit this vulnerability on ISE.   If the user DOES have credentials, and would like to exploit the shellshock,  that CLI user would be able to run generic Linux commands on the ISE node  that they would normally not be able to run (Because the ISE CLI does not  expose generic Linux commands).  However those Linux commands will run as the  logged in CLI user account, not as the Linux root user.  Hence, this limits  exposure of the vulnerability in ISE.  An example of an exploit using  shellshock in ISE would be to view Linux system files they would normally  not be able to view.   The workaround to remove the CLI vulnerability would be to disable the SSH daemon via the following CLI, then reload the ISE node to ensure all SSH  sessions have been terminated.  The following CLI demonstrates how to disable SSH service and reload the ISE node.    ---snip ise1/admin# configure terminal ise1/admin(config)# no service sshd enable  ise1/admin(config)# end ise1/admin# reload Save the current ADE-OS running configuration? (yes/no) [yes] ? yes Continue with reboot? [y/n] y ---snip  Note that reloading the node is important to do after disabling SSH because  it ensures all SSH sessions have been disconnected.  Regarding other exposures to the shellshock bug such as through DHCP or  CGI, we believe ISE is not vulnerable to either, with this reasoning: Related to DHCP server optoins vulnerability, an ISE node never acts as a DHCP client. The IPv4 addresses must be configured statically in ISE,  hence the shellshock attack from DHCP server options flag would never  get called by ISE.   Regarding web interface/CGI vulnerability, the shellshock bug affects  mod_cgi/mod_cgid running on Apache. ISE does not use Apache and Apache is not even installed in ISE.  ISE uses tomcat for its web applications.   Furthermore, within the ISE tomcat webapp configuration, for each webapp  there are no servlet-mappings for CGI.  Given this, we believe ISE is not vulnerable to shellshock from the web/CGI interface.  This defect has been fixed in the following versions of ISE: 1.1.3.x patch 12 1.1.4.x patch 12 1.2.0.x patch 12 1.2.1.x patch 3 1.3.0.876 (FCS)  Conditions: ISE nodes are exposed to this vulnerability only if they have ssh service enabled.  If SSH is enabled, a remote user with ISE CLI credentials will be able to exploit the vulnerability and run generic Linux commands.  Workaround: Disable SSH and reload ISE node as follows (until the ISE patch with the fix for CSCur00532 is installed):  ---snip ise1/admin# configure terminal ise1/admin(config)# no service sshd enable  ise1/admin(config)# end ise1/admin# reload Save the current ADE-OS running configuration? (yes/no) [yes] ? yes Continue with reboot? [y/n] y ---snip  Further Problem Description: PSIRT Evaluation: The Cisco PSIRT has assigned this bug the following CVSS version 2 score.

CSC.sys,all,ssl-vpn,customer-use,2,0,0,CSCud90568,Input queue wedge with SSLVPN DTLS Client Hello," Symptom:   The Input queue of an interface shows 76/75. In show buffers input-interface iinterface/i packet will show UDP packets with the port used by DTLS.  Conditions: This symptom is observed with SSLVPN with DTLS enabled (it is enabled by default, depending on the platform).  Workaround:   You can use the no svc dtls command in the WebVPN group policy configuration mode to disable the DTLS support on the SSL VPN, and reload  the router to clear the interface queue wedge condition.  Embedded Event Manager  A Cisco IOS Embedded Event Manager (EEM) policy that is based on Tool Command Language (Tcl) can be used on vulnerable Cisco IOS devices to  identify and detect an interface queue wedge that is caused by this vulnerability. The policy allows administrators to monitor the interfaces for Cisco IOS  device and detect when the interface input queues are full. When Cisco IOS EEM detects potential exploitation of this vulnerability, the policy can trigger a  response by sending an alert to the network administrator, who could then decide to implement an upgrade, implement suitable mitigations or reload the  device to clear the input queue.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation.  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing the WSA user to visit a malicious website.  Conditions: Devices running an affected version of the Web Security Appliance.  Workaround: None.    PSIRT Evaluation: The Cisco PSIRT has assigned this bug the following CVSS version 2 score. The Base and Temporal CVSS scores as of the time of evaluation are 4.3/4.1: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:U/RC:C&version=2.0 CVE ID CVE-2015-0623 has been assigned to document this issue. Additional information on Cisco's security vulnerability policy can be found at the following URL: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_policy.html  Further Problem Description:   ","Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of vulnerability which allows a malicious actor to run script (e.g., JavaScript) within the web client. Upon a user viewing a page that displays the script content, various actions can be carried out on the user's behalf. These actions might include configuring a new administrative user or changing the viewing user's password. The result of this attack can then be leveraged by the malicious user to gain unauthorized access to the system.A malicious server can send a crafted Content-Type response header to a WSA end user, whichwill trigger an XSS bug in the reporting web GUI. This particular XSS issue is exploitable byunauthenticated remote users.In the admin GUI menu, browse to ""Reporting - Web Tracking""(https://wsa/monitor/reporting_services/tracking_search). Set the ""Time Range"" fieldappropriately, then click the ""Search"" button. For each row in the HTML table of access log entries,the server IP address is displayed. The Content-Type response header is only visible by clickingto bring up the detail view, but the HTML of the Content-Type header is always present in the page.An example attack vector is if an HTTP server responds to a WSA end user with a Content-Typeheader of: img/src=""/""onerror=""alert(1)"". When an admin views the ""Web Tracking"" report'ssearch results, a JavaScript alert will be triggered. This was tested in Internet Explorer 8,and Firefox 26.0 on Linux.There is some filtering of Content-Type; for example, it's truncated after spaces, null bytes, andsemicolons. The Content-Type is also truncated in the access log (viewed via the CLI's `tail`command). Additionally, script tags appear to be defanged on the web client: they appear in thebrowser's DOM, but do not execute code. However, this filtering is not enough to prevent XSS.Viewing the Web Tracking report in the web UI, when it contains an HTTP response with acrafted Content-Type header, can lead to an XSS exploit. It is not necessary for the adminto expand the row containing the malicious Content-Type field; the report merely needsto be loaded in the browser.For general guidance on preventing XSS, please refer to the OWASP guide onXSS prevention: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_(Cross_Site_Scripting)_Prevention_Cheat_SheetIn addition to HTML output encoding, further anti-XSS measures should be put into place.For example, a good defense-in-depth technology is the Content Security Policy header:https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Content_Security_Policy andhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/CSP/Introducing_Content_Security_Policy"," PSIRT-owner: psirt@cisco.com           This issue has been evaluated and driven to closure by PSIRT.

CSC.csg,orion,mc-web-enduser,customer-use,1,0,0,CSCve25950,Cisco WebEx Meetings Server Information Disclosure Vulnerability," Symptom: A vulnerability in Cisco WebEx Meetings Server could allow unauthenticated, remote attackers to gain information that could allow them to access scheduled customer meetings.  The vulnerability is due to an incomplete configuration of the robots.txt file on customer-hosted WebEx solutions and a lack of activation of the Short URL functionality. Note that the Short URL functionality is provided in all releases of Cisco WebEx Meetings Server after version 2.5MR4. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability via an exposed parameter to search for indexed meeting information. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain scheduled meeting information and potentially allow the attacker to attend scheduled, customer meetings.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds are available to address this vulnerability. This advisory is available at the following link: https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170510-cwms  Conditions: A customer site running any currently supported Cisco WebEx Meetings Server release (2.5, 2.6, 2.7, or 2.8).  Cisco-hosted WebEx deployments are NOT impacted by this vulnerability.  Workaround: Customers can enable the Short URL functionality for their individual releases by following the steps outlined below. NOTE: Once Short URL is activated, all previously scheduled meetings become invalid. Customers must reschedule all past recurring meetings. It is also recommended that customers change their meeting passwords when rescheduling for added security protections.

Additional information on Cisco's security vulnerability policy can be found at the following URL: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_policy.html ","Copied from customer's email and confirmed by lab testing.---Example commands/session:First of all create some strange looking files:rt-inet-30-011# echo A  bootflash:-Lrt-inet-30-011# echo A  bootflash:70rt-inet-30-011# echo A  bootflash:-Mrt-inet-30-011# echo A  bootflash:-Frt-inet-30-011# echo A  bootflash:bashrt-inet-30-011# echo A  bootflash:1Now, create a file that is ""large"" enough:rt-inet-30-011# show run  bootflash:runAnd afterwards use following CLI command:rt-inet-30-011# tar create a.tar run -L 1 -M -F bashThe intention of this command from CLI perspective would be to pack all files given after ""a.tar"" into this tar file. Unfortunately the script in /isan/bin/vsh-tar.sh executes tar blindly like this:     tar $tar -f $afile $compress $verbose $remove $absolute $rfiles 2&1 | grep -v ""tar: Removing leading"" | sed $sed_rem_vdcWhere we have following variable substitutions:$tar is ""-c"" from ""create""$afile is ""a.tar"" $compress, $verbose, $remove, $absolute are unused (those are cli parameters we don't set)$rfiles is the list of relative pathes to the files we want to tar, it's generated here: # check files to be added to archive exist rfiles="""" for f in $files; do     # remove current working dir part of file name (make relative)     rfiles=""$rfiles ${f#$wd}""     test -f $f && continue     echo ""file $f does not exist"" | sed $sed_rem_vdc     err=1 doneThis will expand to 'run' '-L' '1 '-M' '-F' 'bash'. For GNU tar it is possible to give parameters after the file list. This gets abused in following way: -M instructs tar to make multiple tars (back in the old days where big files needed to be distributed over multiple tapes) in chunks (-L) of 1 * 1024 byte blocks. When given '-F bash' tar is also instructed to run the command 'bash' after tar switched to another one of those chunks.You probably already got what is happening: After the first 1024 bytes long tar file is created ""bash"" is executed from $PATH. This leads to a bash shell with user rights (that unfortunately is with buffered IO so if you test this, just do some random ""ls -la"" inbetween to get the buffer full). Outcome: (because of the buffered output more or less) interactive bash session with user-rights. Elevation of rights can be done using various techniques.A proposal for a fix from my side: Run tar with ""--"" before $rfiles to tell tar to stop processing parameters:     tar $tar -f $afile $compress $verbose $remove $absolute -- $rfiles 2&1 | grep -v ""tar: Removing leading"" | sed $sed_rem_vdc"," PSIRT-owner: psirt@cisco.com           This issue has been evaluated and driven to closure by PSIRT.
